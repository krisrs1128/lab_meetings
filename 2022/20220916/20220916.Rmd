### Problem Solving in Multi-Omics

Our lab focuses on statistical methods for analyzing multi-omics, and especially
microbiome, data:

.pull-left[
* We are motivated by interdisciplinary projects with microbiologists,
ecologists, and psychologists
* We synthesize and benchmark statistical approaches to solve data
analysis problems within these collaborations
]

### Project 1: Multiscale Topic Alignment 

* We were motivated by a project about bacterial vaginosis
* The literature collapses microbiomes into 5 “community state types,” but we
noticed subtle transitions in participants with the disease
* To addressed this, we developed meta-algorithms for visualizing ensembles of
topic models trained across several scales

### Project 1: Multiscale Topic Alignment

* We found that properties of the alignment graph are useful for count data analysis more generally
  - Can help quantify the degree of mixing across clusters
  - Can help highlight mutually exclusive species
* We wrapped our algorithms in the R package [`alto`](lasy.github.io/alto)

### Project 2: Meditation and the Microbiome

* The Center for Healthy Minds at UW - Madison has had a long history of studying the effects of meditation on well-being
* Motivated by increasing evidence of a gut-brain axis, they now also collect microbiome samples

### Project 2: Meditation and the Microbiome

.pull-left[
* We are supporting a longitudinal RCT that is gathering data from 3000
participants (for reference, my PhD thesis analyzed three subjects...)
* We have adapted concepts from causal mediation analysis to relate sequencing with psychological survey data

### Techniques

A few ideas recur throughout our research,

  * Generative models: These allow us to encode latent structure and integrate
  across data sources and scales
  * Data visualization: Good representations enable hypothesis generation, model
  criticism, and communication
  * Reusable software: We release our methods as accessible R
  packages
