## Visualization in Microbial Community Analysis

---

### Motivating Study (1 of 3)

.pull-left[
1. In `r Citep(bib, "sankaran2019latent")`, we reanalyzed data from `r Citep(bib, "dethlefsen2011incomplete")`, which took longitudinal species count from 3 subjects (52 - 56 timepoints) who took time courses of antibiotics
2. Question: How does the microbiome respond to large scale environmental perturbations?
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/antibiotics_design.svg" width=600/>
]

---

### Wildfire Metaphor

We drew inspiration from our collaborator's ecological metaphors for microbiome perturbations (antibiotics $\approx$ a flash flood or wildfire)

.center[
<img src="figures/adaptive-landscape-scenario-1.svg" width=720/>
]

---

### Initial Visualization

It was helpful to explore the raw data, and we built a small visualization package, `treelapse`, to help query which species were and were not strongly influenced by the perturbations.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
time_data <- read_csv("../20220928/figures/time_data.csv")
edges <- read_csv("../20220928/figures/edges.csv")
display_opts <- list(
  "margin" = list("ts_right" = 30, "ts_left" = 35, "tree_right" = 15, "tree_left" = 15),
  "size_min" = 1,
  "size_max" = 10
)
```


```{r}
library(treelapse)
timebox_tree(time_data, edges, width = 900, height = 350, display_opts = display_opts)
```

---

### Topic Models

* We were inspired by an analogy between text and microbiome data `r Citep(bib, "schloss2007last", .opts = list(cite.style = "numeric"))`
* Samples are like documents, and taxa are like words.
* We took models for summarizing evolving themes across text corpora and applied them to the microbiome

.center[

]

---

### Model Description

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a model that supposes samples
$x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ are drawn independently from,

\begin{align*}
x_i \vert \gamma_i &\sim \text{Mult}\left(n_{i}, \*B\gamma_{i}\right) \\
\gamma_{i} &\sim \text{Dir}\left(\lambda_{\gamma} 1_{K}\right)
\end{align*}
where the columns $\beta_{k}$ of $\*B \in \Delta^{D}$ lie in the $D$
dimensional simplex and are themselves drawn independently from,
\begin{align*}
\beta_{k} \sim \text{Dir}\left(\lambda_{\beta} 1_{D}\right).
\end{align*}

We vertically stack the $N$ $\gamma_i$'s into an $N \times K$ matrix $\Gamma$.

---

### Model Description

The
estimated parameters can be interpreted as,
* $\Gamma \in \Delta_{K}^{N}$: Per-document memberships across $K$ topics.
* $\*B \in \Delta_{V}^{K}$: Per topic distributions over $V$ words.

.center[
<img src="figures/lda_summary.png" width=600/>
]

---

### Model Description

1. Mixed membership is especially useful when data lie along gradients.
2. In this case, the data are more parsimoniously described as a mixture between "prototypical" extreme points

```{r, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 12, echo = FALSE}
mu <- cbind(seq(-10, 10, .05), seq(-10, 10, .05))
x <- (mu + mvrnorm(nrow(mu), rep(0, 2), diag(2))) %>%
  as.data.frame()

cluster_res <- hclust(dist(x))
scales <- seq(2, 8, 2)
x_clusters <- map_dfr(scales, ~ cbind(x, cluster = cutree(cluster_res, .)), .id = "scale") %>%
  mutate(
    cluster = as.factor(cluster),
    scale = scales[as.integer(scale)]
  )

ggplot(x_clusters) +
  geom_point(aes(V1, V2, col = cluster)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ scale) +
  labs(x = "x", y = "y")
```

---

### Learned Mixed Memberships

This model helped reduce the full community data into a few “themes,”

* Vulnerable taxa: Those knocked out the full duration of the perturbation
* Resilient taxa: Those that recover even while perturbations are ongoing
* Robust taxa: Seem to thrive when other community members disappear

* What role does the microbiome play in preterm birth?
* Ravel et al. (2011) use clustering to identify 5 Community State Types (CSTs)
  - Four healthy CSTs are dominated by Lactobacillus variants
  - A fifth, more compositionally diverse CST is associated with preterm birth

* CST 1 (Healthy)

### Hierarchical Topics

1. Our collaborators suspected that finer-grained variations in community structure might be responsible for changes in patient health
2. This suggests using a more hierarchical approach, but traditional hierarchical topic models operate on words, not word counts

.center[
<img src="figures/hierarchical_intuition.svg" width=600/>
]

---

### Topic Alignment Idea

Instead of defining a new type of hierarchical topic model, we wondered whether we could define a meta-algorithm to navigate an ensemble of models fitted at different resolutions.

### Topic Alignment Visualization

* In the diagram below, columns are models and rectangles are topics. 
* The similarity between topics fitted at different resolutions is represented by the width of the connecting branch.

```{r, out.width = 900}
include_graphics("figures/alto_sketches_annotated alignment.png")
```

---

### Implementation

We view an alignment as a graph across the ensemble. Index models by $m$ and topics by $k$. Then,
* Nodes $V$ corresponds to topics, parameterized by $\{\beta^m_{k}, \gamma^m_{k}\}$.
* Edges $E$ are placed between topics from neighboring models, $K$ vs. $K + 1$ topics
* Weights $W$ encode the similarity between topics.

```{r, out.width = 560}
include_graphics("figures/alto_sketches_annotated alignment.png")
```

---

### Alignment via Optimal Transport

Let $V_p$ and $V_q$ be two subsets of topics within the graph.

* Let the total "mass" of $V_p$ be $p = \left\{\Gamma\left(v\right)^T 1 : v \in V_{p}\right\}$. Define $q$ similarly.
* Define the transport cost $C\left(v, v^\prime\right) := JSD\left(\beta\left(v\right), \beta\left(v^\prime\right)\right)$, the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the pair of topic distributions.

```{r out.width = 420}
include_graphics("figures/transport_alignment_conceptual.png")
```

---

### Alignment via Optimal Transport

The weights $W$ can be estimated by solving the optimal transport problem,
\begin{align*}
&\min_{W \in \mathcal{U}\left(p, q\right)} \left<C,W\right> \\
\mathcal{U}\left(p, q\right) := &\{W\in \mathbb{R}^{\left|p\right| \times \left|q\right|}_{+} : W 1_{\left|q\right|} = p \text{ and } W^{T} 1_{\left|p\right|^\prime} = q\}.
\end{align*}

```{r out.width = 440}
include_graphics("figures/transport_alignment_conceptual.png")
```

---

### Diagnostics

* Representing the models by an alignment suggests a few diagnostic measures
* These both help measure topic quality and highlight model mis-specification

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/alto_sketches_diagnotics.png")
```

---

### Example Diagnostic: Refinement

Parent specificity distinguishes two qualitatively different regimes,

* High Refinement: Each topic receives most mass from a unique parent,
corresponding to a true or "compromise" topic
* Low Refinement: Each topic receives substantial mass from several parents,
each corresponding to an arbitrary split of a true topic

```{r, out.width=350}
include_graphics("figures/refinement_diagnostic_example.png")
```

---

### Simulation Example

1. When a topic model is well-specified, this measure can be used to identify the number of topics.
2. When the model is mis-specified, the refinement scores drop off noticeably.

```{r, out.width=780}
include_graphics("figures/gradient_refinement_full.png")
```

---

### VMRC Application

1. When applied to the VMRC dataset, this alignment procedure finds several sub-CSTs that are well-defined.
2. It also highlights that there is more background variation than can be explained by topic models alone.

<!-- (verbal transition: so far our work has been mostly descriptive and visual. Now we want to transition to the value of simulation). -->

---

### Thought Experiment: Blocking in Generative Count Models

1. Imagine that we are helping design a study to evaluate the effectiveness of three treatments on the microbiome (e.g., different diet interventions)
2. It is widely understood that composition varies substantially from person-to-person
3. Therefore, blocking seems natural — we should ask each participant to take all three treatments.

.pull-left[
<img src="figures/blocking_simplex_contrast.png"/>
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/blocking_simplex.png"/>
]
---

### Navigating Tradeoffs

1. There is a big difference between asking a subject to go through one vs. three interventions. 
2. To judge between statistical efficiency and participant burden, we can use a simulation.
3. We use a variation of the logistic normal model.

\begin{align*}
x_{i} \vert p_{i} &\sim \Mult\left(N_{i}, p_{i}\right) \\
p_{i} &\sim \Scal\left(\beta_{t_{i}} + \tau_{s_{i}}\right) \\
\beta_{t, A} &\sim \Gsn\left(0, \sigma^2_{\beta}\begin{pmatrix} I_{\absarg{A}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0_{\absarg{A^C}} \end{pmatrix}\right) \\
\tau_{s} &\sim \Gsn\left(0, \sigma^2_{\tau}I_{D}\right)
\end{align*}

---

### Blocking Simulation Results

1. When $N = 60, \sigma_{\beta}^2 = 0.5$ and $\sigma^2_{\tau} = 2$, the unblocked model’s 95% credible intervals are about 1.3 times larger than the blocked model’s
2. The unblocked model also makes spurious associations, since subjects might
have large abundances (regardless of treatment assignment)

.center[
<img src="figures/blocking_counts.png" width=600/>
]

---

### Blocking Simulation Results

1. The simulation will depend on parameter choices, but this generated data provide specific material for comparison
2. We include several other experimental design-related examples in the review paper `r Citep(bib)`.

---

### Motivating Study (3 of 3)

Meditation is known to induce change on a variety of physiological processes, so it is natural to ask whether there is a relationship with the microbiome.

This is not so far fetched,
* There are documented relationships with anxiety and depression `r Citep(bib, c("winter2018gut", "peirce2019role", "dash2015gut"))`
* The mechanisms may be related to the Gut-Brain Axis `r Citep(bib, c("foster2013gut", "carabotti2015gut", "mayer2015gut"))`

---

### Study Population and Design

The Center for Healthy Minds (CHM) recruited police officers into the study, since they have high stress jobs. The treatment group received meditation training just before the second timepoint.

```{r, out.width=800}
theme_set(theme_bw())
load("figures/data_prep.RData")
info %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(subject) %>%
  mutate(
    group = case_when(
      group == "WLC" ~ "Waitlisted Control",
      group == "MBRT" ~ "Treatment"
    ),
    trt = as.factor(ifelse(trt, "Yes", "No")),
    total = n()
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(timepoint, reorder(subject, total), color = as.factor(trt), fill = as.factor(trt)), size = .5) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = 1:3) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c( "#4bbf95", "#BF4B75")) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#328c6b", "#8c3252")) +
  facet_grid(group ~ ., scale = "free_y", space = "free_y") +
labs(x = "Timepoint", y = "Subject", fill = "Intervention?", col = "Intervention?") +
theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
    )
```

---

### Psychometric & Genomic Integration

1. Our pilot study has psychometric and microbiome compositional data, and ongoing collection is gathering additional immunological and behavioral data
2. Changes in one might be associated with effects across all. To approach this, we use the language of graphical modeling.

<img src="figures/integration.svg"/>

---


### Mediation Analysis

Mediation models are a type of graphical model where a treatment $T$ can influence a response $Y$ either directly or indirectly through a mediator variable $M$ `r Citep(bib, c("imai2010general"))`. This is formalized through a series of
chained regression models,

\begin{align*}
m_{i} &= \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{T}t_{i} + \alpha_{X}^{T}x_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}^{m} \text{ (mediation model)}\\
y_{i} &= \beta_{0} + \beta_{T}t_{i} + \beta_{X}^{T}x_{i} + \beta_{M}^{T}m_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}^{y} \text{ (outcome model) }.
\end{align*}

```{r, out.width = 300, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/mediation-dag.svg")
```

---

### Counterfactual Perspective

* Typically the direct and indirect effects are read off $\alpha_{T}$ and
$\beta_{T}$.
* A more general approach considers the counterfactual difference in potential outcome `r Citep(bib, c("imai2010general"))`,
\begin{align}
\tau_{i} &= y_{i}\left(x_i, 1, m\left(x_{i}, t_i\right)\right) - y_{i}\left(x_i,0, m\left(x_{i}, t_i\right)\right),\\
\delta_{i} &= y_{i}\left(x_i, t_{i}, m\left(x_{i}, 1\right)\right) - y_{i}\left(x_i, t_{i}, m\left(x_{i}, 0\right)\right),
\end{align}
  and estimate $\Earg{\tau_{i}}$ and $\Earg{\delta_{i}}$ over the population.
* This is viewed as intervening on the treatment and mediator, respectively

---
### Counterfactual Perspective

For example, if there is no mediation effect, the $m_i$ are unaffected by the
treatment. Nonetheless, there can still be a large direct effect.

```{r, out.width = 540, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/counterfactual-mediation2.svg")
```

---
### Counterfactual Perspective

Alternatively, the treatment can influence the response entirely by changing the
typical value of the mediator.

```{r, out.width = 600, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/counterfactual-mediation3.svg")
```

---
### Counterfactual Perspective

Both types of effects can exist simultaneously.

```{r, out.width = 700, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/counterfactual-mediation4.svg")
```

---

### Models under Consideration

Equipped with this graphical and counterfactual perspective, we used a probabilistic programming language to implemented a variety of microbiome mediation modeling components,

1. Logistic Normal Multinomial
2. Zero-Inflation via Mixtures
3. Model Change from Baseline
4. Latent Topic Component

These can also be recombined (e.g., zero inflation with latent topic components). I have supplementary slides in case you are curious about details.

---

### Model Comparison

Rather than describing individual models, I would like to focus on model
comparison. The difficulty is that standard evaluation approaches are not
sufficient,

1. Prediction performance: Good prediction of future composition doesn’t
guarantee effective inference of direct or indirect effects.
2. Traditional Simulation: Simulating from one of the assumed model structures
gives it an unfair advantage.

---

### Zero-Inflated Quantiles (ZINQ)

1. We resolve these difficulties by defining a semisynthetic simulator, following the ZINQ approach of `r Citep(bib, "ling2021powerful")`.
2. This approach estimates a CDF for each species using a hurdle-like decomposition,
    \begin{align*}
     \logit{\Parg{y_{i} > 0 \vert x_{i}}} = \gamma^{T}x_{i} \\
     Q_{y}\left(\tau \vert x_{i}, y_{i} > 0\right) = \beta\left(\tau\right)^{T}x_{i}
    \end{align*}
    where $Q_{y}\left(\tau\right)$ is the conditional $\tau^{th}$ quantile of a nonzero count.

---

### Model Fidelity

This model generates quite realistic data.

---

### Toy Experiment

* Before getting to the meditation study, let's see how these simulation
strategies compare on a simple setup.
* Consider the problem of evaluating a logistic normal multinomial (LNM) model,

\begin{align*}
y_{i} \sim \Mult\left(N_{i}, \varphi^{-1}\left(\beta_{0} + \beta_{T}x_{i}\right)\right)
\end{align*}
where $\varphi^{-1}\left(x\right) \propto\left(\exp{x_{1}}, \dots, \exp{x_{K-1}}, 1\right)$.

---

### Synthetic Setup

In the first simulation, we simulate from a version of the LNM itself,

\begin{align*}
y_{i} &\sim \Mult\left(N_{i}, \varphi^{-1}\left(\beta_{0} + \beta_{T}x_{i}\right)\right) \\
\beta_{T} &:= \text{Threshold}\left(\tilde{\beta}_{T}, 0.75\right) \\
\beta_{0}, \tilde{\beta}_{T} &\sim \Gsn\left(0, I_{K}\right) \\
\end{align*}

.center[
<img src="figures/lnm-spherical.png" width=500/>
]

---

### Semisynthetic Setup

In the second, we use the exact same $\beta_{T}$, but this is used to
exponentially tilt samples from treatment,

\begin{align*}
y_{i} \sim \Mult\left(N_{i}, \exp{\beta_{T}x_{i}}\hat{p}_{i}^{\ast}\right)
\end{align*}
where $\hat{p}_{i}^{\ast}$ is drawn randomly with replacement from compositions
in an observed pilot dataset (the meditation study data, in this case).

---

### Simulation Comparison

To compare strategies, we compute the false sign rate (FSR) and power across
species with increasingly large estimated effect sizes, analogous to an ROC
curve.

---

### Simulation Comparison

The purely synthetic simulation setup leads to overoptimistic power and FSR
estimates, compared to the semisynthetic setup.

.center[
<img src="figures/semisynthetic_comparison.png" width=950/>
]

---

### Graphical ZINQ

1. We can adapt this to the graphical model setting by estimating nonparametric relationships across edges.
2. We can estimate ground truth direct and indirect effects by simulating from known $\gamma$ and $\beta\left(\tau\right)$.

]

---

### Semisynthetic Simulation Recipe

1. Estimate $\hat{\gamma}, \hat{\beta}\left(\tau\right)$ from real data.  This defines $\hat{F}_{y \vert x, t, m}$ from which to simulate community profiles.
2. Rank species according to true effects. To define true positives and negatives, we set true effects for all but the top 25% to 0.
3. Simulate data alternative configurations. We vary the sample size and rescale coefficients $\hat{\beta}\left(\tau\right)$
4. Estimate models across settings and compute error rates.

---

### Calibration

Notice that we can use our simulation strategy to calibrate our inferences,

  1. Rank direct and indirect effects
  2. Use simulation to estimate the FSR across thresholds
  3. Use most powerful threshold that controls estimated FSR

---

### Comparison of Mediation Models

* This strategy helps us choose between competing models
* For FSR $\leq$ 10%, we find that time-aware LNM variant has the highest power
* Across all models, we are better powered to detect direct rather than indirect
effects

---

### Takeaways

Together, visualization and simulation allow us to describe reality accurately and imagine underlying mechanisms creatively.

*Visualization*

Data visualization is like cartography — by reducing what is shown in a display,
we can make essential structure clear And like a map, good visualization
supports navigation across unfamiliar territory

*Simulation*

Hypothetical reasoning is a central part of statistics, and generative models
can make alternative scenarios concrete. This reasoning is useful for more than
data analysis — it is a powerful device for experimental design and model
evaluation
