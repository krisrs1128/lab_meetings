### Motivation: Microbiome Data Analysis

.pull-left[
* How should we describe the bacterial ecosystems that surround (and
inhabit) us?
* An improved understanding would support human and environmental health

---

### Motivation: Microbiome Data Analysis

* Technologies like 16S and metagenomic sequencing have given us a novel, detailed view of the microbiome
* Microbe abundances are recorded in a high-dimensional count matrix
  - We often have supplemental data associated with each row (sample) and column
  (microbe)

---

### Two Useful Methods

(show screenshots from a few different papers on this topic)

* Hierarchical clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation have both been
fruitfully applied in microbiome data analysis
* They provide useful visual artifacts from what would otherwise be overwhelming datasetse

---

### Hierarchical Clustering

.pull-left[
* Agglomorative hierarchical clustering sequentially merges pairs of clusters
that are "closest" to one another
  - E.g., those having smallest pairwise distances to one another
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}
example(hclust) # maybe provide a more microbiome-oriented version of this
```
]

---

### Limitations Hierarchical Clustering

If the data in fact lie along a gradient, then it is artificial to use a
clustering procedure.

---

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic model that supposes samples
$x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ are drawn independently from,

\begin{align*}
x_i \vert \gamma_i &\sim \text{Mult}\left(n_{i}, B\gamma_{i}\right) \\
\gamma_{i} &\sim \text{Dir}\left(\lambda_{\gamma} 1_{K}\right)
\end{align*}
where the columns $\beta_{k}$ of $B \in \Delta^{D}$ lie in the $D$
dimensional simplex and are themselves drawn independently from,
\begin{align*}
\beta_{k} \sim \text{Dir}\left(\lambda_{\beta} 1_{D}\right).
\end{align*}

We vertically stack the $N$ $\gamma_i$'s into an $N \times K$ matrix $\Gamma$.

---

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Topic models are well-suited to count data dimensionality reduction. The
estimated parameters can be interpreted as,
* $\Gamma \in \Delta_{K}^{N}$: Per-document memberships across $K$ topics.
* $B \in \Delta_{V}^{K}$: Per topic distributions over $V$ words.

```{r, out.width = 600}
include_graphics("figure/lda_overview.png")
```

---


### Limitations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation

* LDA does not support navigation across scales.
* It can give a useful overview, but it doesn't support "focusing in" onto
specific patterns of interest

---

### The Best of Both Worlds

Our ideal method would a type of blend between hierarchical clustering and LDA.
It would support,
* Navigation: Multiscale methods help the analyst navigate
 richness-interpretability trade-offs between views
* Parsimony: Support for partial membership can reduce the number of prototypes
 needed

---

### Main Idea

* We will fit an ensemble of generative models of varying levels of complexity (Parsimony, Evaluation)
* We will build a compact representation of the result (Navigation)

# Methodology

---

### Topic Models
---

### Interpretation


(Need to introduce some sort of transitional idea at this point)

---

### Alignment as a Graph

We view an alignment as a graph across the ensemble. Index models by $m$ and
topics by $k$. Then,
* Nodes $V$ corresponds to topics, parameterized by $\{\beta^m_{k}, \gamma^m_{ik}\}$.
* Edges $E$ are placed between topics from neighboring models ($K$ vs. $K + 1$ topics)
* Weights $W$ encode the similarity between topics.

---

### Notation

This graph-based view provides a convenient notation,

* $m\left(v\right)$ is the model for node $v$
* $k\left(v\right)$ is the topic for node $v$
* $\Gamma\left(v\right) := \left(\gamma_{i v\left(k\right)}^m\left(k\right)\right) \in \reals^n_{+}$ is the vector of
mixed memberships for topic $v$
* $\beta\left(v\right) := \beta_{k}^m \in \Delta^{D}$ is the
corresponding topic distribution
* $e = \left(v, v'\right)$ is an edge linking topics $v$ and $v'$.

---

### Estimating Weights: Product approach

To compute weights, we can use,
\begin{align*}
w\left(e\right) = \Gamma\left(v\right)^T\Gamma\left(v'\right)
\end{align*}

```{r out.width = 420}
include_graphics("figure/product_alignment.png")
```

---

### Estimating Weights: Transport approach

Let $V_p$ and $V_q$ be two subsets of topics within the graph.

* Let the total "mass" of $V_p$ be $p = \left\{\Gamma\left(v\right)^T 1 : v \in V_{p}\right\}$. Define $q$ similarly.
* Define the transport cost $C\left(v, v^\prime\right) := JSD\left(\beta\left(v\right), \beta\left(v^\prime\right)\right)$, the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the pair of topic distributions.

```{r out.width = 400}
include_graphics("figure/transport_alignment.png")
```

---

### Estimating Weights: Transport approach


The weights $W$ can than be estimated by solving the optimal transport problem,
\begin{align*}
&\min_{W \in \mathcal{U}\left(p, q\right)} \left<C,W\right> \\
\mathcal{U}\left(p, q\right) := &\{W\in \mathbb{R}^{\left|p\right| \times \left|q\right|}_{+} : W 1_{\left|q\right|} = p \text{ and } W^{T} 1_{\left|p\right|^\prime} = q\}.
\end{align*}

```{r, out.width = 400}
include_graphics("figure/transport_alignment.png")
```

---

### Summaries

* Representing the models by an alignment suggests a few summary measures
* These summaries help measure topic quality
* They can also be used to diagnose model mis-specification

---

### Paths

For each $v$, identify the incoming edge with the highest normalized weight,
\begin{align*}
  e^\ast\left(v\right) = \arg \max_{e : \text{target}\left(e\right) = v} \tilde{w}_{\text{out}}\left(e\right) + \tilde{w}_{\text{in}}\left(e\right).
\end{align*}

* Iterate this process from large to small $l$ to construct a set of distinct paths along the alignment
* The number of unique paths is a useful property of an alignment

```{r, out.width=270}
include_graphics("figure/branch_construction-1.png")
```

---

### Paths

For each $v$, identify the incoming edge with the highest normalized weight,
\begin{align*}
  e^\ast\left(v\right) = \arg \max_{e : \text{target}\left(e\right) = v} \tilde{w}_{\text{out}}\left(e\right) + \tilde{w}_{\text{in}}\left(e\right).
\end{align*}

* Iterate this process from large to small $l$ to construct a set of distinct paths along the alignment
* The number of unique paths is a useful property of an alignment

```{r, out.width=270}
include_graphics("figure/branch_construction-3.png")
```

---

### Paths

For each $v$, identify the incoming edge with the highest normalized weight,
\begin{align*}
  e^\ast\left(v\right) = \arg \max_{e : \text{target}\left(e\right) = v} \tilde{w}_{\text{out}}\left(e\right) + \tilde{w}_{\text{in}}\left(e\right).
\end{align*}

* Iterate this process from large to small $l$ to construct a set of distinct paths along the alignment
* The number of unique paths is a useful property of an alignment

```{r, out.width=270}
include_graphics("figure/branch_construction-2.png")
```

---

### Refinement

Suppose there are actually $K_0$ topics in the data. If we fit a model with
$K$ topics, then

* $K < K_0$: True topics are merged together into "compromise" topics
* $K > K_0$: True topics are arbitrarily split

---

### Refinement

A consequence is that parent specificity differs between these regimes,

* $K < K_0$: Each topic receives most mass from a unique parent, corresponding to a true or "compromise" topic
* $K > K_0$: Each topic receives substantial mass from several parents, each
 corresponding to an arbitrary split of a true topic

include_graphics("figure/refinement-branches-2.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width=350}
include_graphics("figure/refinement-branches.png")
```
]

---

### Coherence

The coherence of a topic is defined as its average connectedness to other topics
along the same branch,

\begin{align*}
 c(v) = \frac{1}{|\text{Path}\left(v\right)|} \sum_{v' \in \text{Path}\left(v\right)} \min\left(\win\left(v, v'\right), \wout\left(v, v'\right) \right)
\end{align*}
  
 * Topics that are transient (appearing at one $K$ and disappearing at
 another) have low coherence scores
 * Topics that are consistently recovered across choices of $K$ have high
 coherence

---

### True LDA Model

A sanity check is compute the alignment of data that are in fact generated by an LDA model (true $K = 5$).
* $N = 250, D = 1000, \lambda_{\gamma} = 0.5, \lambda_{\beta} = 0.1$

```{r, out.width = 480}
include_graphics("figure/transport-true-lda.png")
```

---

### Summaries

.pull-left[
The summary measures suggest that the true $K$ is 5.

# ## LDA with background variation

What happens when the LDA model is mis-specified? Consider the following
generative mechanism,

\begin{align*}
x_{i} \vert \*B, \gamma_{i}, \nu_i &\sim \Mult\left(x_{i} ; N_{i}, \alpha \*B\gamma_{i} + \left(1 - \alpha\right)\nu_i\right) \\
\nu_{i} &\sim \Dir\left(\lambda_{\nu}\right) \\
\gamma_i &\sim \Dir\left(\lambda_{\gamma}\right) \\
\beta_{k} &\sim \Dir\left(\lambda_{\beta}\right),
\end{align*}

where $\*B$ stacks the $\beta_k$ rowwise.

---

### Result

The alignment structure is sensitive to changes in $\alpha$ and fragments when
LDA structure is not present.

---

### Strain switching

Our final simulation mimics the strain switching problem.
* Small subsets of species switch between two otherwise similar topics
* Multiple resolutions are required to detect the difference

---

###  Mechanism

We first construct equivalence classes of similar topics $\tilde{\beta}_k^r$.
Then, for each sample $i$ and each $k$, we draw one member from the class

\begin{align*}
\beta_{k}^{i} &\sim \Unif\left(\left\{\tilde{\beta}_{k}^{1}, \dots, \tilde{\beta}_{k}^{R}\right\}\right)
\end{align*}

stack the results into $B^{i}$, and then draw,

\begin{align}
x_{i} &\sim \Mult\left(n_{i}, B^{i}\gamma_{i}\right)
\end{align}
as in standard LDA.

---

### Results
* There are five topics, the first two of which exhibit strain switching
* At smaller $K$, we recognize the five main topics
* At larger $K$, we are able to recognize switching within the first two topics

---

### Results

* At larger $K$, we are able to recognize instances of switching

# Data Analysis

---

### Known structures

* Historically, the vaginal microbiome has been split into 5 separate
community state types (CSTs).
   - Four are considered healthy, and are each dominated by a Lactobacillus strain
   - One dysbiotic CST is characterized by lack of a dominant Lactobacillus

---

.pull-left[
* We recover the 4 Lactobacillus Community State Types that have been previously documented
* Within the dysbiotic CST, we detect 2 consistently different community structures
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width=800}

```
]

---

### Interpretations

 * We recover the 4 Lactobacillus Community State Types that have been previously documented
 * Within the dysbiotic CST, we find 2 persistent community structures

### Software

 Topic alignment is implemented in the R package [alto](lasy.github.io/alto).
 
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(purrr)
library(alto)

# simulate data and fit models
x <- rmultinom(20, 5000, rep(0.1, 500))
lda_params <- setNames(map(1:10, ~ list(k = .)), 1:10)
lda_models <- run_lda_models(x, lda_params)

# perform alignment
result <- align_topics(lda_models)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(result)
```
]

All the simulations discussed today are vignettes in the package. (We will
create a binder link for people to try)
