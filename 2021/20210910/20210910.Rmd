All philosophy is based on two things only: curiosity and poor eyesight. The
trouble is, we want to know more than we can see.

### Data-Driven Methodology

.pull-left[
The Latent Structure Lab is motivated by scientific studies of the microbiome
and climate change

* **Microbiome: How should we describe the bacterial ecosystems that surround (and
inhabit) us?**

* Climate Change: What can we learn about the large scale Earth Systems impacted
by climate change?

### Data Visualization

* We provide strategies for navigating complex, high-dimensional data
* We study ideas from dimensionality reduction and interactive visualization
* We aim to build tools that are easy to learn and use

### Latent Structure

Groupings and gradients can allow investigators to rapidly assess the overall
landscape of their data or model outputs.

### Project 1: Multiscale Topic Visualization

* Biological systems are multiscale -- genes organize into pathways, cells
organize into tissues, bacteria organize into communities, ...
* We've studied meta-algorithms for visualizing ensembles of topic models
trained across several scales

### Project 1: Multiscale Topic Visualization

* We build a graph across the ensemble using ideas from optimal transport
* Properties of the alignment graph can summarize the topic model collection
* Can we extend this thinking to the multi-omic context?

### Project 1: Multiscale Topic Visualization

* You can try these ideas out in the R package [`alto`](lasy.github.io/alto)
* `remotes::install_github('lasy/alto')`

### Project 2: Monitoring Glacial Lakes

* We work with a nonprofit called ICIMOD to monitor ecosystem change in
the Himalaya
* We have implemented deep learning and level-set algorithms for measuring
change in glaciers and glacial lakes

### Project 2: Monitoring Glacial Lakes

* The key observation is that we can use information across the whole time
course
* We can apply data visualization principles to streamline navigation over the results
