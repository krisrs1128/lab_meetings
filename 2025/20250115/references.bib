  abstract = 	 {We seek to learn models that we can interact with using high-level concepts: if the model did not think there was a bone spur in the x-ray, would it still predict severe arthritis? State-of-the-art models today do not typically support the manipulation of concepts like "the existence of bone spurs", as they are trained end-to-end to go directly from raw input (e.g., pixels) to output (e.g., arthritis severity). We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts ("bone spurs") or bird attributes ("wing color"). These models also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.}

                  to their size, complexity, and often opaque internal state.
                  In addition, many systems, such as image classifiers, operate
                  on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To
                  address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation
                  Vectors (CAVs), which provide an interpretation of a neural
                  net's internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The
                  key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a
                  neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use
                  CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that
                  uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which
                  a user-defined concept is important to a classification
                  result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of ``zebra''
                  is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image
                  classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may
                  be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a
                  standard image classification network as well as a medical

  abstract  = "Summary In many supervised learning applications, understanding
               and visualizing the effects of the predictor variables on the
               predicted response is of paramount importance. A shortcoming of
               black box supervised learning models (e.g. complex trees, neural
               networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbours,
               local kernel-weighted methods and support vector regression) in
               this regard is their lack of interpretability or transparency.
               Partial dependence plots, which are the most popular approach
               for visualizing the effects of the predictors with black box
               supervised learning models, can produce erroneous results if the
               predictors are strongly correlated, because they require
               extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far
               outside the multivariate envelope of the training data. As an
               alternative to partial dependence plots, we present a new
               visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects
               plots, which do not require this unreliable extrapolation with
               correlated predictors. Moreover, accumulated local effects plots
               are far less computationally expensive than partial dependence
               plots. We also provide an R package ALEPlot as supplementary
               material to implement our proposed method.",

  abstract     = "Mean decrease in impurity (MDI) is a popular feature
                  importance measure for random forests (RFs). We show that the
                  MDI for a feature $X_k$ in each tree in an RF is equivalent
                  to the unnormalized $R^2$ value in a linear regression of the
                  response on the collection of decision stumps that split on
                  $X_k$. We use this interpretation to propose a flexible
                  feature importance framework called MDI+. Specifically, MDI+
                  generalizes MDI by allowing the analyst to replace the linear
                  regression model and $R^2$ metric with regularized
                  generalized linear models (GLMs) and metrics better suited
                  for the given data structure. Moreover, MDI+ incorporates
                  additional features to mitigate known biases of decision
                  trees against additive or smooth models. We further provide
                  guidance on how practitioners can choose an appropriate GLM
                  and metric based upon the Predictability, Computability,
                  Stability framework for veridical data science. Extensive
                  data-inspired simulations show that MDI+ significantly
                  outperforms popular feature importance measures in
                  identifying signal features. We also apply MDI+ to two
                  real-world case studies on drug response prediction and
                  breast cancer subtype classification. We show that MDI+
                  extracts well-established predictive genes with significantly
                  greater stability compared to existing feature importance
                  measures. All code and models are released in a full-fledged

Efforts to make the rationales behind the models{'} predictions transparent have inspired an abundance of new explainability techniques. Provided with an already trained model, they compute saliency scores for the words of an input instance. However, there exists no definitive guide on (i) how to choose such a technique given a particular application task and model architecture, and (ii) the benefits and drawbacks of using each such technique. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive list of diagnostic properties for evaluating existing explainability techniques. We then employ the proposed list to compare a set of diverse explainability techniques on downstream text classification tasks and neural network architectures. We also compare the saliency scores assigned by the explainability techniques with human annotations of salient input regions to find relations between a model{'}s performance and the agreement of its rationales with human ones. Overall, we find that the gradient-based explanations perform best across tasks and model architectures, and we present further insights into the properties of the reviewed explainability techniques.",
