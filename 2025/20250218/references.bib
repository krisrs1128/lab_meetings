  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing data lie at the heart of modern
               microbiome research. Effective analysis of these data requires
               careful preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation to detect
               subtle signals and avoid spurious associations. In this review,
               we discuss how simulation can serve as a sandbox to test
               candidate approaches, creating a setting that mimics real data
               while providing ground truth. This is particularly valuable for
               power analysis, methods benchmarking, and reliability analysis.
               We explain the probability, multivariate analysis, and
               regression concepts behind modern simulators and how different
               implementations make trade-offs between generality,
               faithfulness, and controllability. Recognizing that all
               simulators only approximate reality, we review methods to
               evaluate how accurately they reflect key properties. We also
               present case studies demonstrating the value of simulation in
               differential abundance testing, dimensionality reduction,
               network analysis, and data integration. Code for these examples
               is available in an online tutorial (https://go.wisc.edu/8994yz)
               that can be easily adapted to new problem settings.",
