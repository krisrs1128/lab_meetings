  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing data lie at the heart of modern
               microbiome research. Effective analysis of these data requires
               careful preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation to detect
               subtle signals and avoid spurious associations. In this review,
               we discuss how simulation can serve as a sandbox to test
               candidate approaches, creating a setting that mimics real data
               while providing ground truth. This is particularly valuable for
               power analysis, methods benchmarking, and reliability analysis.
               We explain the probability, multivariate analysis, and
               regression concepts behind modern simulators and how different
               implementations make trade-offs between generality,
               faithfulness, and controllability. Recognizing that all
               simulators only approximate reality, we review methods to
               evaluate how accurately they reflect key properties. We also
               present case studies demonstrating the value of simulation in
               differential abundance testing, dimensionality reduction,
               network analysis, and data integration. Code for these examples
               is available in an online tutorial (https://go.wisc.edu/8994yz)

  abstract  = "AbstractHere, we investigate whether (and how) experimental
               design could aid in the estimation of the precision matrix in a
               Gaussian chain graph model, especially the interplay between the
               design, the effect of the experiment and prior knowledge about
               the effect. Estimation of the precision matrix is a fundamental
               task to infer biological graphical structures like microbial
               networks. We compare the marginal posterior precision of the
               precision matrix under four priors: flat, conjugate
               Normal-Wishart, Normal-MGIG and a general independent. Under the
               flat and conjugate priors, the Laplace-approximated posterior
               precision is not a function of the design matrix rendering
               useless any efforts to find an optimal experimental design to
               infer the precision matrix. In contrast, the Normal-MGIG and
               general independent priors do allow for the search of optimal
               experimental designs, yet there is a sharp upper bound on the
               information that can be extracted from a given experiment. We
               confirm our theoretical findings via a simulation study
               comparing (i) the KL divergence between prior and posterior and
               (ii) the Stein's loss difference of MAPs between random and no
               experiment. Our findings provide practical advice for domain
               scientists conducting experiments to better infer the precision
               matrix as a representation of a biological network.",

  abstract  = "Bacterial microbiota play a critical role in mediating local and
               systemic immunity, and shifts in these microbial communities
               have been linked to impaired outcomes in critical illness.
               Emerging data indicate that other intestinal organisms,
               including bacteriophages, viruses of eukaryotes, fungi, and
               protozoa, are closely interlinked with the bacterial microbiota
               and their host, yet their collective role during antibiotic
               perturbation and critical illness remains to be elucidated. We
               employed multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) to systematically
               integrate the bacterial (16S rRNA), fungal (intergenic
               transcribed spacer 1 rRNA), and viral (virus discovery
               next-generation sequencing) components of the intestinal
               microbiota of 33 critically ill patients with and without sepsis
               and 13 healthy volunteers. In addition, we quantified the
               absolute abundances of bacteria and fungi using 16S and 18S rRNA
               PCRs and characterized the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
               butyrate, acetate, and propionate using nuclear magnetic
               resonance spectroscopy. We observe that a loss of the anaerobic
               intestinal environment is directly correlated with an overgrowth
               of aerobic pathobionts and their corresponding bacteriophages as
               well as an absolute enrichment of opportunistic yeasts capable
               of causing invasive disease. We also observed a strong depletion
               of SCFAs in both disease states, which was associated with an
               increased absolute abundance of fungi with respect to bacteria.
               Therefore, these findings illustrate the complexity of
               transkingdom changes following disruption of the intestinal
               bacterial microbiome.IMPORTANCE While numerous studies have
               characterized antibiotic-induced disruptions of the bacterial
               microbiome, few studies describe how these disruptions impact
               the composition of other kingdoms such as viruses, fungi, and
               protozoa. To address this knowledge gap, we employed MOFA to
               systematically integrate viral, fungal, and bacterial sequence
               data from critically ill patients (with and without sepsis) and
               healthy volunteers, both prior to and following exposure to
               broad-spectrum antibiotics. In doing so, we show that modulation
               of the bacterial component of the microbiome has implications
               extending beyond this kingdom alone, enabling the overgrowth of
               potentially invasive fungi and viruses. While numerous
               preclinical studies have described similar findings in vitro, we
               confirm these observations in humans using an integrative
               analytic approach. These findings underscore the potential value
               of multi-omics data integration tools in interrogating how
               different components of the microbiota contribute to disease
               states. In addition, our findings suggest that there is value in
               further studying potential adjunctive therapies using anaerobic
               bacteria or SCFAs to reduce fungal expansion after antibiotic
               exposure, which could ultimately lead to improved outcomes in
               the intensive care unit (ICU).",
