### Microbiome Data

1. A microbiome is a microbe-scale ecosystem.  It can be described by taxonomic
composition, genomic function, and biochemical features.

1. Advances in sequencing technology have made it easier than ever to rapidly
profile these taxonomic and genomic features in a range of sites, including in
the human body, on plant roots, and in the oceans. For this reason, they have
become an important part of medical, agricultural, and environmental questions.

---

### Statistical Challenges

Developing the data analysis for a microbiome study can be complicated by a
number of factors.

* **Integration**: How should we analyze data gathered from multiple batches or
technologies?

* **Experimental Design**: How should we arrange sampling, assign treatments,
and place controls so that we can have powerful statistical conclusions?

* **Reproducibility**: How can we be sure our conclusions are trustworthy?

### Data Analysis Controversy `r Citep(bib, "retraction2024")`

    <img src="figures/retraction.png"/>
]

In June 2024, Nature retracted a paper `r Citep(bib, "Poore2020")` the claimed
identify microbiome signatures of cancer. This came after one year's worth of
debate `r Citep(bib, c("Gihawi2023", "SepichPoore2023", "SepichPoore2024"))`
about the data analysis.

### Data Analysis Controversy `r Citep(bib, "retraction2024")`

    <img src="figures/retraction.png"/>
]

The "disease signature" was an artifact resulting from the use of a batch effect
correction method.  Before we can understand the nuances of the story, we need
to learn about batch effects and correction methods.

---

### Simulation to Resolve Controversy

Gerry Tonkin-Hill has an excellent re-analysis `r Citep(bib, "githubGitHubGtonkinhillTCGA_analysis")` of the data from `r Citep(bib, "Poore2020")` which sheds light what were likely the source of the phantom
signals. The first part is a simulation.

### The Changing Simulation Landscape

Historically, microbiome researchers have only rarely used simulation in
their data analysis workflow.

  * Time Consuming: The simulators would have to be written from scratch, which requires significant effort.
  * Unrealistic: Even afterwards, the resulting data may not be realistic enough to use to guide any practical conclusions.

However, in the last few years, the situation has changed quite noticeably.

---

### Semisynethic Data

One of the major advances has been the design of algorithms that can leverage public data resources.

* Semisynthetic Data: The output from a simulator that has been designed to mimic external, template data. 
* Template Data: Previously gathered experimental data that can be used to train a simulator.

These new algorithms lift some of the responsibility of the simulation designer
-- it's no longer necessary to start from a blank slate.

---

### New Packages

We also have many more well-designed packages that implement these new
methodologies.

### Talk Outline

This talk will center around examples of how simulated data can be applied to
resolve questions in microbiome data analysis.

1. Differential Abundance - Benchmarking
1. Dimensionality Reduction - Power Analysis
1. _Interlude on Evaluation_
1. Data Integration - Reliability Analysis
1. Mediation Analysis - Designing Models

I hope you can share some examples of how you might want to use simulation in
your own work.

## Differential Abundance Analysis

---

### Setup

A common question in microbiome analysis is whether a given taxon is more vs.
less abundant in some conditiosn vs. others. This can be framed as a multiple
hypothesis testing problem. For example,

\begin{align*}
H_{0j}: \mu_{A} = \mu_{A}\\
H_{1j}: \mu_{A} \neq \mu_{A}\\
\end{align*}

---

### True and False Discoveries

There are many methods available for this problem. They make different
assumptions about the data and may be sensitive to different types of signal.
Ideally, a method should,

* Maximize Power: Recover all taxa that are truly differentially abundant.
* Minimize False Discoveries: Don't accidentally flag uninteresting taxa.

---

### Simulation Example

We can customize a benchmark to our particular data set. In this example, we

1. Trained a simulator to mimic data from (tk: Give the study citation and dimensions)
1. Deliberately removed the effects from the (tk: how many) taxa with the
weakest effects according to a Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Step (2) can be thought of as a _computational negative control_. Together, we
can generate realistic data with ground truth signals.

---

### Benchmarking Analysis

These are the results of three popular differential abundance methods across a
range of sample sizes. We've run (tk) simulation replicates for each
configuration.

All methods controlled the FDR and continue to benefit from more samples even
after $n = 500%.

---

### Implementation

1. For this simulator, we used a zero-inflated Negative Binomial variant of the
scDesign3 model.

1. This model can accommodate high overdispersion -- high variance even with low
mean -- and high data sparsity. To create true positives, means and variances
were allowed to vary across BMI groups.

---

## Supervised Dimensionality Reduction

---

### Community-wide Associations

1. In DA analysis, we can draw conclusions one taxon at a time. In many
problems, though, we are interested in the relationships across a collection of
taxa.

1. These analysis require more advanced methods, like network or dimensionality
reduction techniques.

---

### Motivation: Power Analysis

.pull-left[
1. Power analyses are intended to prevent researchers from embarking on studies
that have very little chance of detecting the hypothesized signals.

1. While formulas are available for simple univariate analysis, no analogous
power formulas are available for more complex, multivariate models.

### sPLS-DA Setting

Our power analysis uses Sparse Parital Least Squares Discriminant Analysis
(sPLS-DA) `r Citep(bib, c("Le_Cao2008-zz", "Le_Cao2011-kn", "Rohart2017-sa"))`. This topic is it's
own full workshop, but let's review the core ideas.

.pull-left[
sPLS-DA helps with prediction when, 

* s: Not all features are predictive
* PLS: Many features are correlated with one another
* DA: The response is one of $K$ classes

### sPLS-DA Intuition

We "blend" columns of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ within tables until the patterns look similar.

Roughly, choose weights $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ to maximize
$\text{cor}\left(\mathbf{Xa}, \mathbf{Yb}\right)$.

correlation with previously found patterns.
