  abstract  = "New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for
               analyzing read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method
               estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts,
               generates a precision weight for each observation and enters
               these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This
               opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology
               developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom
               performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even
               when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the
               earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear
               modeling and gene set testing methods.",
