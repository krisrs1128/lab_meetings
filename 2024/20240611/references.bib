               generates a precision weight for each observation and enters
               these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This
               opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology

               when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the

               analysis methods: current status and potential solutions",
  author    = "Yang, Lu and Chen, Jun",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Differential abundance analysis (DAA) is one central
               statistical task in microbiome data analysis. A robust and
               powerful DAA tool can help identify highly confident microbial
               candidates for further biological validation. Numerous DAA tools
               have been proposed in the past decade addressing the special
               characteristics of microbiome data such as zero inflation and
               compositional effects. Disturbingly, different DAA tools could
               sometimes produce quite discordant results, opening to the
               possibility of cherry-picking the tool in favor of one's own
               hypothesis. To recommend the best DAA tool or practice to the
               field, a comprehensive evaluation, which covers as many
               biologically relevant scenarios as possible, is critically
               needed. RESULTS: We performed by far the most comprehensive
               evaluation of existing DAA tools using real data-based
               simulations. We found that DAA methods explicitly addressing
               compositional effects such as ANCOM-BC, Aldex2, metagenomeSeq
               (fitFeatureModel), and DACOMP did have improved performance in
               false-positive control. But they are still not optimal: type 1
               error inflation or low statistical power has been observed in
               many settings. The recent LDM method generally had the best
               power, but its false-positive control in the presence of strong
               compositional effects was not satisfactory. Overall, none of the
               evaluated methods is simultaneously robust, powerful, and
               flexible, which makes the selection of the best DAA tool
               difficult. To meet the analysis needs, we designed an optimized
               procedure, ZicoSeq, drawing on the strength of the existing DAA
               methods. We show that ZicoSeq generally controlled for false
               positives across settings, and the power was among the highest.
               Application of DAA methods to a large collection of real
               datasets revealed a similar pattern observed in simulation
               studies. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the benchmarking study, we
               conclude that none of the existing DAA methods evaluated can be
               applied blindly to any real microbiome dataset. The
               applicability of an existing DAA method depends on specific
               settings, which are usually unknown a priori. To circumvent the
               difficulty of selecting the best DAA tool in practice, we design
               ZicoSeq, which addresses the major challenges in DAA and
               remedies the drawbacks of existing DAA methods. ZicoSeq can be
               applied to microbiome datasets from diverse settings and is a
               useful DAA tool for robust microbiome biomarker discovery. Video

  abstract  = "The development of increasingly efficient and cost-effective
               high throughput DNA sequencing techniques has enhanced the
               possibility of studying complex microbial systems. Recently,
               researchers have shown great interest in studying the
               microorganisms that characterise different ecological niches.
               Differential abundance analysis aims to find the differences in
               the abundance of each taxa between two classes of subjects or
               samples, assigning a significance value to each comparison.
               Several bioinformatic methods have been specifically developed,
               taking into account the challenges of microbiome data, such as
               sparsity, the different sequencing depth constraint between
               samples and compositionality. Differential abundance analysis
               has led to important conclusions in different fields, from
               health to the environment. However, the lack of a known
               biological truth makes it difficult to validate the results
               obtained. In this work we exploit metaSPARSim, a microbial
               sequencing count data simulator, to simulate data with
               differential abundance features between experimental groups. We
               perform a complete comparison of recently developed and
               established methods on a common benchmark with great effort to
               the reliability of both the simulated scenarios and the
               evaluation metrics. The performance overview includes the
               investigation of numerous scenarios, studying the effect on
               methods' results on the main covariates such as sample size,
               percentage of differentially abundant features, sequencing
               depth, feature variability, normalisation approach and
               ecological niches. Mainly, we find that methods show a good
               control of the type I error and, generally, also of the false
               discovery rate at high sample size, while recall seem to depend

               have been more challenging to study. Here we present a pipeline
               for the assessment of intestinal microbiota localization within

               response variable is presented which we call the generalized
               additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model
               assumes independent observations of the response variable y
               given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values
               of the random effects. The distribution for the response
               variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general
               family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic
               continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of
               the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean
               (or location) but also of the other parameters of the
               distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric
               (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or
               random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation
               is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton--Raphson or
               Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized)
               likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using
               a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated
               into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of

               sequencing datasets has led to widespread but inconsistent use

               that much of this terminology is unhelpful and confusing, and
               outline simple ideas to help to reduce confusion. These include:
               (1) observed single-cell RNA sequencing counts reflect both true
               gene expression levels and measurement error, and carefully
               distinguishing between these contributions helps to clarify
               thinking; and (2) method development should start with a Poisson
               measurement model, rather than more complex models, because it
               is simple and generally consistent with existing data. We
               outline how several existing methods can be viewed within this
               framework and highlight how these methods differ in their
               assumptions about expression variation. We also illustrate how

               obtained from a common set of samples arise in many scientific
               applications. A common problem in the exploratory analysis of
               such data is to identify groups of features of different data
               types that are strongly associated. A bimodule is a pair (A,B)
               of feature sets from two data types such that the aggregate
               cross-correlation between the features in A and those in B is
               large. A bimodule (A,B) is stable if A coincides with the set of
               features that have significant aggregate correlation with the
               features in B, and vice-versa. This paper proposes an
               iterative-testing based bimodule search procedure (BSP) to
               identify stable bimodules. Compared to existing methods for
               detecting cross-correlated features, BSP was the best at
               recovering true bimodules with sufficient signal, while limiting
               the false discoveries. In addition, we applied BSP to the
               problem of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis
               using data from the GTEx consortium. BSP identified several
               thousand SNP-gene bimodules. While many of the individual
               SNP-gene pairs appearing in the discovered bimodules were
               identified by standard eQTL methods, the discovered bimodules
               revealed genomic subnetworks that appeared to be biologically
               meaningful and worthy of further scientific investigation.",

               and medical perspectives. Viewed through a biostatistical lens,
               many microbiome analysis goals can be formulated as latent
               variable modeling problems. However, although probabilistic
               latent variable models are a cornerstone of modern unsupervised
