       "['– Computer viruses are parasitic programs which are able to replicate themselves, attach themselves to other executables in the computer, and perform some unwanted and often malicious actions. A virus is not able to spread itself to another computers, some user actions are needed for it to infect a new computer. Downloading and running software from untrusted sources, inserting an USB drive without a previous scan–remember always disable the AutoRun feature for the drives as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs– , downloading and running emails or IM attachments even from known persons, can put you in the nasty situation to have an infected computer. Always when you deal with these situations and to prevent computer infections, scan before to run.\\nThe best scanners in my opinion are multi-engine online scanners like virustotal.com or novirusthanks.org. The links of these scanners and many more are on the home page.\\nThe main three features of a virus are :\\n– the replication mechanism search and find other executable files in your computer, check if the files are already infected–it has a special mechanism for that and if the file is clean then append itself to the file. It can append to the front, middle or end of the executable file thus changing the file size. This is also the reason why the number of new created viruses decreased in the last years, the AntiViruses has a very simple mechanism for “checking and compare” the files size –checksums at different period of times and a file bigger in size than at a previous date is a sign of infection.\\nA special category of viruses are “Bacteria” viruses, they replicate themselves so quickly and in a such percentage that the harddisk will run very soon out of free space.\\n– a trigger is designed to activate a task of the virus, as displaying strange messages, deleting files, sending emails, begin the replicate process or whatever the programmer write in his malicious code. The trigger can be a certain date in calendar–formerly know as Time Bombs, the time when some event occur, opening a certain program or other users actions. The trigger is very important for the virus spreading, because once infected the user will notice nothing strange in his computer, and will continue to spread the virus without to suspect anything. Other reason of this delaying of infection symptoms is for viruses to hide its tracks, the user simply does not know when and how it get infected.\\n– the task or “payload” can differ from inoffensive ones like displaying joke messages, to deleting or editing important system files like hosts file , deleting or editing registry entries, sometimes making the computer unbootable.\\nUsing polymorphic engines, the viruses change the “virus signature”–their binary code each time when they infect a new computer making very difficult for AntiViruses to detect them using traditional “signature based” scanners.\\nMacro Viruses can attach themselves to the executable portion of a spreadsheet documents in AutoOpen, AutoClose, AutoExit, or other file macros. The words processors are the most affected by these viruses, so to prevent the computer infections, always perform an AntiVirus scan for documents received as emails attachments, or received by another methods from another computers.\\n– Computer worms are a special category of viruses with a very important feature added : they can spread themselves between computers, without the user interaction, exploiting some networks vulnerabilities or facilities as network shares or remote file executions. It’s recommended by some experts to disable the Windows Remote Assistance feature, seeing this as a possibly vulnerability. Once it infect a computer it looks forward for other computers connected to the network–LAN or Internet continuing to search for possibly victims.\\n– Trojans are malicious executable files, masquerading as beneficial programs and tricking users to run their code. Very often they are embedded into other programs as setup or installers file and shared into the forums or blogs as pirated software(warez), so when the user run the installer of a program, the trojan will run in parallel infecting the computer. It’s a server-client software and once infecting a computer, it gives to the hacker where it connects the full power over the computer.\\nThe hacker can see screenshots of the victims computer, can see the webcam in real time, can download and upload files or run other malware.\\nThey are very trendy in nowdays and deserve a special attention, so a more detailed description of this type of malware will be given in the part 2 of this article.\\n– Spyware is a malicious code able to gather private data from an infected computer and send it to the hacker. The data can be passwords, credit card numbers, login credentials and other private data. They accomplish their mission by using various mechanisms for decrypting passwords previously saved in web-browsers, keyloggers or screenshots. The computer user get infected by spyware in several ways by downloading and running “fake antiviruses” or “registry cleaners” or visiting malicious sites t',\n",

These names are almost completely in the Cornish language (the Brittonic used in Cornwall and a relative of Welsh and Breton.\\nSometime before C6 the closely related South-western British and Western British languages started to look less like Gaulish and more like the modern p-Celtic languages, and Cornish, Welsh, Breton and Cumbric (extinct) began taking shape as modern European languages. Cornish and Breton (from South-western British) eventually diverged from each other during the last part of the Early Medieval Period.\\nThere will have been dialectic differences in these regions of Brittonic usage as well as differences in naming practice between them, but the structure and many name elements of Early Cornish personal names broadly follows that of early names found in Britain, Ireland, Gaul and Celt-Iberia. It is these names that have come down (with modification) to Cornish today including well known names such as Arthur, Gerent and Winwaloe.\\nCornish is one of the oldest indigenous languages of Britain, with its roots stretching back thousands of years and to the first settlements of Britain (believed to be the Late Neolithic, when farming was established).',\n",

The following factors are fundamental to the approach, which links local artists with classroom teachers and students to create performances and boost literacy:\\nLiteracy and Performance Objectives. All the work of the performance unit–writing, reading, theater activities, rehearsals, and performance–aim toward specific and clearly stated literacy and performance objectives (such as those of New Standards and the National Standards for Arts Education).\\nCulminating Performance. All Arts/Literacy units culminate in a student performance in front of an audience including at least students and teachers.\\nReturn to Text. At various points during the unit, Arts/Literacy classrooms return to the original text to deepen student comprehension or writing development and to evaluate literacy learning.\\nTeachers and Artists as Collaborators. The teaching team of teacher and artist co-plan and co-teach the unit, actively facilitating daily classroom activities.\\nStudents as Artists. Performances draw on students’ skills, knowledge, and culture in a student-centered environment where the students become actors, writers, and directors.\\nExperience Live Theater. Visiting professional theater performances inspires the students to set a high standard for their own performances. It also creates a common theater language and experience for the teacher, artist, and student, providing a glimpse into the vocation and culture of the professional artist.\\nReflective Practice. Teachers, artists, and students reflect on their own teaching and learning on both a daily and a unit level and discuss ways to improve their work.\\nFor more information, contact the Arts/Literacy Project at (401) 863-7785 (401) 863-7785 or on the Web at www.artslit.org.',\n",

       " \"Irish is a living, modern language, spoken by many people and communities in Ireland and studied by people all around the globe. I would be doing Irish a great disservice if I were to present it as an ancient tongue used only for ritual or reading ancient texts.\\nHowever, our Grove does use Irish for certain elements of our ritual, as it is the language of the land and of our ancestors. Participants, even those who have no Irish, have often told me that hearing ritual in Irish was a moving or exhilarating experience for them.\\nAs this page develops, I hope to post videos of Irish being used in ritual, and short lessons to help with pronunciation.\\nImbas and Awen As OBOD Druids, we are accustomed to chanting the Awen. Awen is a Welsh term for the poetic inspiration which flows through us in the moments when we are truly connected. The equivalent Irish word is Imbas, and as Irish Druids we sometimes chant Imbas instead of, or as well as, Awen.\\nHere is a short video of myself and Philip Carr-Gomm teaching workshop participants how to chant the Imbas:\\nPaidir an Draoi - The Druid's Prayer Tabhair dúinn a OllSpiorad do chosaint Grant, Oh Great Spirit, your protection Agus i gCosaint Neart And, in protection, strength Agus i Neart Tuiscint And, in strength, understanding Agus i dTuiscint Eolas And, in understanding, knowledge Agus i nEolas Eolas an Chirt And, in knowledge, the knowledge of justice Agus i nEolas an Chirt an grá faoi And, in the knowledge of justice, the love of it Agus i nGrá faoi an grá do na beathaí ar fad And in the love of it, the love of all existences Agus i nGrá do na beathaí ar fad an Grá do OllSpiorad And in the love of all existences, the love of the Great Spirit agus gach maitheas a bhaineann leis And of all goodness. Translated by Eimear Burke Special thanks to Eleanor Cantwell for her support and advice with this translation.\\nThe Directions in Irish\\nFor those wishing to hear how spoken Irish works in ritual, I recommend the following video. It records a ritual held at the sacred site of Uisneach to show Irish solidarity with the water protectors of Standing rock. At 3 mins 30 secs, four priestesses call the four directions in Irish.\\nTaking 3 Breaths with the Land, Sea and Sky\\nIn OBOD ritual, we take 3 breaths at the start of ritual. Here is that segment of the ritual in both English and Irish.\\nCalling for peace\\nWe call for peace, for without peace, no work can be....\",\n",
       " 'The German Genitive\\nDer Genitiv im Deutschen – Erklärungen und Beispiele\\nThe German Genitive – Summary\\nA noun is in the genitive case when it is a attribute of another noun or when it indicates possession. German usually use the question “Wessen?” to determine the genitive element of a sentence.\\n- “Der Hund der Familie liegt hier.”\\n- “Das Auto des Fremden parkt hier.”\\n- “Das Fenster des Hauses ist kaputt.”\\nThere are three types of declension for the genitive, which are indicated by the article and the wordending.\\n- (e)s-Declension(“das Pferd – des Pferdes, der Hund- des Hundes”).\\nNearly all neutral and masculine nouns in genitive are part of this declension. When nouns end with “-s, -ß, -x, -z, -tz” the “e” has to be used.\\n- (e)n-Declension (“der Treue – des Treuen”).\\nEspecially masculine nouns in genitive with the endings “-e, -ant, -ent, -ist” are part of this declension. The “e” is left in nouns ending with “-e, -el, -er” or in nouns ending in vowels.\\n- Declension without endings (“die Frau – der Frau”).\\nHere belong all the female nouns in genitive. In plural, always the article “der” is used and the noun is written as it would be in nominative.\\nWelcome to language-easy.org! Well, as you have clicked on this article, I suppose that you want to know everything about a basic element in German grammar – The German genitive. Of course, most of you have heard of this case, as it also exists in the English language. However, the construction of the forms of German genitive is completely different to the English one. Well, although this German case might be a little bit complicated, you have to be conscious that it is of crucial importance to express possession and other things.\\nIn the following, I’d like to give you a short description of the German genitive and also talk about its correct usage. Furthermore, it is important to mention the special declension of pronouns in the German genitive.\\nBy the way, in case you’d like to have some additional information about German conditional clauses, just have a look at this article on Wikipedia. Hopefully, it will provide you with all the background information that you need.\\nAnd now, let’s not lose too much time and come to the first part of this article and talk about what the German genitive case actually is. Auf geht’s!\\nDescription and Usage of the German Genitive\\nBeschreibung und Anwendung des Gentiiv im Deutschen\\nNow, we come to the first topic of this article about the German genitive. So, I’d like to give you a short description of the German genitive. Please, try to keep this description in mind – it is always useful to know what we are actually talking about.\\nThe German genitive case indicates possession. Whereas in the English language you use an “-‘s” or the preposition “of” to show position, in German you add “-es” or “-er” to dependent possessive pronouns.\\nWell, in German we use the genitive after certain prepositions, verbs and adjectives. Furthermore, we can use the question “wessen” (whose) to find the German genitive case. Unfortunately, asking this question to find the German genitive does not make too much sense to English speakers. So, I’d like to show you some more ways to recognize the German genitive.\\n- First, the German genitive, as already mentioned, indicated possession.\\n“Das ist Philip, mein Bruder.”\\n- Second, it also comes with certain propositions, like “wegen”, “trotz” and “anstelle”.\\n“Wegen Philips Hund, ist mein Strumpf kaputt.”\\n- And third, the German genitive occurs after certain verbs as a genitive object.\\n“Philip freut sich seines Hundes wegen.”\\nSo, after clearing up the basics about the German genitive, let’s come to the next point of this article and talk about the declension of pronouns in the German genitive.\\nThe Declension of Pronouns in the German Genitive\\nDie Deklination von Pronomen im Genitiv\\nNow, we come to another important topic in the context of the German genitive, the declension of pronouns in this grammatical case. Well, keep in mind that we only use dependent possessive pronouns in the genitive case. Furthermore, you should always remind that personal pronouns and independent possessive pronouns cannot be put into the German genitive. So, in the following table I’d like to give you an overview about the mentioned dependent possessive pronouns and their genitive endings.\\nOf course, you can observe clearly the endings “-es” and “-er”, as already mentioned in the short description of the German genitive above.\\nFinally, we have reached the last part of this article where you can prove the German skills you have just learned. In the following you will see some phrases that you should complete with the correct terms. Once you have filled all the gaps, just click on the “correct” button and you can see your errors and the correct results. Good luck and… auf Wiedersehen!',\n",

       " \"Thursday, 22 February 2024 | 02:42 AM\\nGenerosity and gratitude are two characteristics that go hand in hand. In the materialist world today, where people are running after having the most material or worldly possessions, having someone who could offer something to others to help them out is a big act of generosity. In return, if you do not have anything to offer, making dua for one who has offered you some of his wealth is an act of gratitude.\\nIslam emphasizes sharing and looking out for others. When someone shares their wealth with you, you should return the favor, but when you cannot, acknowledge it with gratitude and show generosity towards the person who is sharing.\\nAbu Hurairah narrated that Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said that those who do not thank the people have not thanked Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى) [Sunan Abī Dāwūd 481]. This hadith clearly states that one must not feel entitled but rather be full of gratefulness for the way the people around have helped them in any way.\\nMorning & Evening\\n'Asbahnaa ('Amsaynaa) 'alaa fitratil-'Islaami wa 'alaa kalimatil-'ikhlaasi, wa 'alaa deeni Nabiyyinaa Muhammadin, wa 'alaa millati 'abeenaa 'Ibraaheema, haneefan Musliman wa maa kaana minal-mushrikeen.\\nWe have entered the morning (evening) upon the natural religion of Islam, the word of sincere devotion, the religion of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the faith of our father Ibrahim. He was upright (in worshipping Allah), and a Muslim. He was not of those who worship others besides Allah. (Recite in the bracket in the evening.)\\nWhen making dua for one who has offered you some of his wealth, be expressive in your thanks and show gratitude to both Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى) and the person who has been made a way in which Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى) is providing you. Pray for their abundance with the genuine intention that Allah rewards them for their generosity and Allah puts you in a position where you are also able to share to help others. Offer the supplication with humbleness and the intention of reciprocating kindness.\\nThe benefits of making dua for someone who has offered their wealth help both people. It opens a giver's heart to give more and share the good they are blessed with. For the receiver, it allows them to acknowledge the way that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى) is showing them generosity. It encourages the spirit of being helpful to others and being kind. It fosters bonds of generosity and kindness in the community and instills a feeling of gratitude in people for what they are receiving.\\nWhen someone shares their wealth with you, you pray for the blessing of Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى) on that person, their family, and wealth with the intention of gratitude.\\nOne should pray for a lawful livelihood that benefits them and the community rather than simply asking for abundance in their wealth.\",\n",

Notice where the “” marks are and where the () are. Examples from OWL: Wordsworth stated that Romantic poetry was marked by a \"spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\" (263). Romantic poetry is characterized by the \"spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\" (Wordsworth 263). Wordsworth extensively explored the role of emotion in the creative process (263).\\nI N -T EXT C ITATIONS FROM A WEB SOURCE MLA requires the use of the first field from the bibliography citation. If there is an author listed, that is the first field. If there is no author, then the first field is typically the title of the article. There is no page # requirement for web documents. Avoid using the URL in the text of a paragraph. Example from OWL: During the presentation, Jane Yates stated that invention and pre-writing are areas of rhetoric that need more attention. This example directs the reader to look for this author’s name on the Works Cited page at the end of the paper. Note: It is always fine to add another field as well, like the author and the article title, for clarity.\\nM IXING SOURCES – HOW MUCH TO CITE ? Within 1 paragraph, a source must only be cited once. For example, in a paragraph about your book, you will have 2 quotes. Each will have a different page number in () at the end, but you only need to identify the author the first time you quote the book. (Unless you have another source mentioned that comes between the 2 book quotes.) Use good transition words to connect sentences that are from the same source: Example: Later in the book… If you identify 2 different sources in one paragraph, each must be completely cited.\\nW HEN I N D OUBT – LOOK IT UP OR ASK!
