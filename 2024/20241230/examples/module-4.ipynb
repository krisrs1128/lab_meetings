      "['– Computer viruses are parasitic programs which are able to replicate themselves, attach themselves to other executables in the computer, and perform some unwanted and often malicious actions. A virus is not able to spread itself to another computers, some user actions are needed for it to infect a new computer. Downloading and running software from untrusted sources, inserting an USB drive without a previous scan–remember always disable the AutoRun feature for the drives as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs– , downloading and running emails or IM attachments even from known persons, can put you in the nasty situation to have an infected computer. Always when you deal with these situations and to prevent computer infections, scan before to run.\\nThe best scanners in my opinion are multi-engine online scanners like virustotal.com or novirusthanks.org. The links of these scanners and many more are on the home page.\\nThe main three features of a virus are :\\n– the replication mechanism search and find other executable files in your computer, check if the files are already infected–it has a special mechanism for that and if the file is clean then append itself to the file. It can append to the front, middle or end of the executable file thus changing the file size. This is also the reason why the number of new created viruses decreased in the last years, the AntiViruses has a very simple mechanism for “checking and compare” the files size –checksums at different period of times and a file bigger in size than at a previous date is a sign of infection.\\nA special category of viruses are “Bacteria” viruses, they replicate themselves so quickly and in a such percentage that the harddisk will run very soon out of free space.\\n– a trigger is designed to activate a task of the virus, as displaying strange messages, deleting files, sending emails, begin the replicate process or whatever the programmer write in his malicious code. The trigger can be a certain date in calendar–formerly know as Time Bombs, the time when some event occur, opening a certain program or other users actions. The trigger is very important for the virus spreading, because once infected the user will notice nothing strange in his computer, and will continue to spread the virus without to suspect anything. Other reason of this delaying of infection symptoms is for viruses to hide its tracks, the user simply does not know when and how it get infected.\\n– the task or “payload” can differ from inoffensive ones like displaying joke messages, to deleting or editing important system files like hosts file , deleting or editing registry entries, sometimes making the computer unbootable.\\nUsing polymorphic engines, the viruses change the “virus signature”–their binary code each time when they infect a new computer making very difficult for AntiViruses to detect them using traditional “signature based” scanners.\\nMacro Viruses can attach themselves to the executable portion of a spreadsheet documents in AutoOpen, AutoClose, AutoExit, or other file macros. The words processors are the most affected by these viruses, so to prevent the computer infections, always perform an AntiVirus scan for documents received as emails attachments, or received by another methods from another computers.\\n– Computer worms are a special category of viruses with a very important feature added : they can spread themselves between computers, without the user interaction, exploiting some networks vulnerabilities or facilities as network shares or remote file executions. It’s recommended by some experts to disable the Windows Remote Assistance feature, seeing this as a possibly vulnerability. Once it infect a computer it looks forward for other computers connected to the network–LAN or Internet continuing to search for possibly victims.\\n– Trojans are malicious executable files, masquerading as beneficial programs and tricking users to run their code. Very often they are embedded into other programs as setup or installers file and shared into the forums or blogs as pirated software(warez), so when the user run the installer of a program, the trojan will run in parallel infecting the computer. It’s a server-client software and once infecting a computer, it gives to the hacker where it connects the full power over the computer.\\nThe hacker can see screenshots of the victims computer, can see the webcam in real time, can download and upload files or run other malware.\\nThey are very trendy in nowdays and deserve a special attention, so a more detailed description of this type of malware will be given in the part 2 of this article.\\n– Spyware is a malicious code able to gather private data from an infected computer and send it to the hacker. The data can be passwords, credit card numbers, login credentials and other private data. They accomplish their mission by using various mechanisms for decrypting passwords previously saved in web-browsers, keyloggers or screenshots. The computer user get infected by spyware in several ways by downloading and running “fake antiviruses” or “registry cleaners” or visiting malicious sites t', 'For those unfamiliar with Cornish, it is classed as a p-Celtic member of the family of Celtic languages, which was once spoken across much of Europe, and is now restricted to the insular world and Brittany: the only surviving languages being Cornish, Welsh and Breton (all p-Celtic), and Manx, Scots Gaelic and Irish (all q-Celtic).\\nThe relationship between these two branches is illustrated by p-Celtic words such as peduar W and their q-Celtic equivalents: cethar [Ir].\\nThe etymology, morphology, syntax and phonology of Cornish and the other Celtic languages ultimately derive from a putative proto-Indo European or proto-Celtic language or family of languages spoken in Britain in pre-history.\\nCornish Onomastics is the study of onomastics (personal name data) and toponymics (place name data) in relation to Cornwall in the Early Medieval Period (350 CE to 1000 CE). These names are almost completely in the Cornish language (the Brittonic used in Cornwall and a relative of Welsh and Breton.\\nSometime before C6 the closely related South-western British and Western British languages started to look less like Gaulish and more like the modern p-Celtic languages, and Cornish, Welsh, Breton and Cumbric (extinct) began taking shape as modern European languages. Cornish and Breton (from South-western British) eventually diverged from each other during the last part of the Early Medieval Period.\\nThere will have been dialectic differences in these regions of Brittonic usage as well as differences in naming practice between them, but the structure and many name elements of Early Cornish personal names broadly follows that of early names found in Britain, Ireland, Gaul and Celt-Iberia. It is these names that have come down (with modification) to Cornish today including well known names such as Arthur, Gerent and Winwaloe.\\nCornish is one of the oldest indigenous languages of Britain, with its roots stretching back thousands of years and to the first settlements of Britain (believed to be the Late Neolithic, when farming was established).', 'Our cultural identity: Experience the culture and heritage of Cyprus Course Description Culture has the power to transform entire societies, strengthen local communities and forge a sense of identity and belonging for\\nOur cultural identity: Experience the culture and heritage of Cyprus\\nCulture has the power to transform entire societies, strengthen local communities and forge a sense of identity and belonging for people of all ages.

The following factors are fundamental to the approach, which links local artists with classroom teachers and students to create performances and boost literacy:\\nLiteracy and Performance Objectives. All the work of the performance unit–writing, reading, theater activities, rehearsals, and performance–aim toward specific and clearly stated literacy and performance objectives (such as those of New Standards and the National Standards for Arts Education).\\nCulminating Performance. All Arts/Literacy units culminate in a student performance in front of an audience including at least students and teachers.\\nReturn to Text. At various points during the unit, Arts/Literacy classrooms return to the original text to deepen student comprehension or writing development and to evaluate literacy learning.\\nTeachers and Artists as Collaborators. The teaching team of teacher and artist co-plan and co-teach the unit, actively facilitating daily classroom activities.\\nStudents as Artists. Performances draw on students’ skills, knowledge, and culture in a student-centered environment where the students become actors, writers, and directors.\\nExperience Live Theater. Visiting professional theater performances inspires the students to set a high standard for their own performances. It also creates a common theater language and experience for the teacher, artist, and student, providing a glimpse into the vocation and culture of the professional artist.\\nReflective Practice.

Expository texts are any text that is non-fiction: newspaper articles, informational journals, blogs, magazine articles are just the beginning.\\nNote: At a later time, we can discuss how any types of videos or audio recordings can also be analyzed for rhetoric.\\nAnalyze a newspaper article for rhetoric.\\n- Students will begin to see that any text can be analyzed for rhetoric.\\n- Students will have a beginning knowledge of the meaning of ethos, pathos, and logos.\\n- Print out or find a newspaper article that you are interested in.\\n- Use the printable to discuss or write the answers to each question one by one. Know that each question will have an answer and each answer might be challenging to find. Look beyond the obvious!!\\n- Skip any questions that you are really struggling with and come back to them later.\\n- After you have completed as many questions as possible, go back to the ones you skipped. One that you might struggle with is this: What does the author want you to do with the information? Most likely, he/she wants you to change your opinion on a subject, describe.\\n- Think about some additional questions about the author: What opinion does the author have about the subject? Who is the audience of the article?\\n- Now respond to the article with your opinion: Do you agree or disagree with the author? Explain. Would you recommend or mention this article to someone you know? Who and why?\\nLeave a comment if you downloaded this and completed the activity.
