               rRNA and metagenomic sequencing data is difficult due to their
               sparse nature. In this article, we propose using copula models
               with mixed zero-beta margins for the estimation of taxon-taxon
               covariations using data of normalized microbial relative
               abundances. Copulas allow for separate modeling of the
               dependence structure from the margins, marginal covariate
               adjustment, and uncertainty measurement. RESULTS: Our method
               shows that a two-stage maximum-likelihood approach provides
               accurate estimation of model parameters. A corresponding
               two-stage likelihood ratio test for the dependence parameter is
               derived and is used for constructing covariation networks.
               Simulation studies show that the test is valid, robust, and more
               powerful than tests based upon Pearson's and rank correlations.

               such data makes it a challenge to extract biological
               information. We developed staNMF, a method that combines a
               scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization
               (NMF) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion.
               When applied to a set ofDrosophilaearly embryonic spatial gene
               expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind,
               staNMF identified 21 principal patterns (PP). Providing a
               compact yet biologically interpretable representation
               ofDrosophilaexpression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map

               We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a
               computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance

               still in their infancy. The challenges include few time points

               each variable separately and joined with a dependence structure
               characterized by a copula. The class of multivariate copulas was
               limited for a long time to elliptical (including the Gaussian
               and t-copula) and Archimedean families (such as Clayton and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Variable selection on high throughput biological
               data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms
               (SNPs), becomes inevitable to select relevant information and,
               therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic
               structure. There are different ways to perform variable
               selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly
               used to identify differentially expressed features for
               explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper
               approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of
               multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use
               multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into
               cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits. RESULTS: A
               simple extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is
               proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass
               classification framework. CONCLUSIONS: sPLS-DA has a
               classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse
               discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and SNP
               data sets. More importantly, sPLS-DA is clearly competitive in
               terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of
               interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs.

               and medical perspectives. Viewed through a biostatistical lens,
               many microbiome analysis goals can be formulated as latent

               latent variable models are a cornerstone of modern unsupervised

               varying abundances and is shown to be associated with many
               diseases. An important first step in many microbiome studies is
               to identify possible distinct microbial communities in a given
               data set and to identify the important bacterial taxa that
               characterize these communities. The data from typical microbiome
               studies are high dimensional count data with excessive zeros due
               to both absence of species (structural zeros) and low sequencing
               depth or dropout. Although methods have been developed for
               identifying the microbial communities based on mixture models of
               counts, these methods do not account for excessive zeros
               observed in the data and do not differentiate structural from

               from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80\% detection

              cornerstone of single cell data analysis, critically affecting
              downstream results. Yet, how much biological signal is erased
              during integration? Currently, there are no guidelines for when
              the biological differences between samples are separable from
              batch effects, and thus, data integration usually involve a lot
              of guesswork: Cells across batches should be aligned to be
              ``appropriately'' mixed, while preserving ``main cell type
              clusters''. We show evidence that current paradigms for single
              cell data integration are unnecessarily aggressive, removing
              biologically meaningful variation. To remedy this, we present a
              novel statistical model and computationally scalable algorithm,
              CellANOVA, to recover biological signal that is lost during
              single cell data integration. CellANOVA utilizes a
              ``pool-of-controls'' design concept, applicable across diverse
              settings, to separate unwanted variation from biological
              variation of interest. When applied with existing integration
              methods, CellANOVA allows the recovery of subtle biological
              signals and corrects, to a large extent, the data distortion
              introduced by integration. Further, CellANOVA explicitly
              estimates cell- and gene-specific batch effect terms which can be
              used to identify the cell types and pathways exhibiting the
              largest batch variations, providing clarity as to which
              biological signals can be recovered. These concepts are
              illustrated on studies of diverse designs, where the biological
              signals that are recovered by CellANOVA are shown to be validated
              by orthogonal assays. In particular, we show that CellANOVA is
              effective in the challenging case of single-cell and
              single-nuclei data integration, where the recovered biological
              signals are replicated in an independent study.",

               Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from

               to remove unwanted technical or biological variations and
               integrate heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Despite their wide
               usage, existing methods suffer from several fundamental
               limitations. In particular, we lack a rigorous statistical test
               for whether two high-dimensional single-cell datasets are
               alignable (and therefore should even be aligned). Moreover,
               popular methods can substantially distort the data during
               alignment, making the aligned data and downstream analysis
               difficult to interpret. To overcome these limitations, we
               present a spectral manifold alignment and inference (SMAI)
               framework, which enables principled and interpretable
               alignability testing and structure-preserving integration of
               single-cell data with the same type of features. SMAI provides a
               statistical test to robustly assess the alignability between
               datasets to avoid misleading inference and is justified by
               high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of real

               component-based approach which aims to study the relationships

               affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in

               Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis
