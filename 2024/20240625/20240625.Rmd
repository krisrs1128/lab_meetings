### Learning Outcomes:

1. Explain and distinguish between the horizontal and vertical integration
problems.
1. Discuss how simulation can improve validity and power in horizontal and
vertical integration workflows.
1. Design simulators that respect batch or multi-omics structure to support
integration applications.

## Horizontal Integration
]

### Motivation

1. We can learn a lot by paying attention to as many relevant datasets as
possible. We shouldn't pretend that we haven't seen related data before!

1. Unfortunately, technical factors can cause systematic differences between
groups of samples. These are often called "batch effects."

### Sources of Batch Variation

These kind of unwanted variation can result from:

* Variation in experimental or sequencing protocols.

* Differences in library size.

* Variation in dataset storage methods.

* Uninteresting, but real, biological variation: situation in cell cycle,
differing proportions of dead cells.

### General Approaches

Many methods have been proposed to do this. They mostly fall into one of two
categories,

1. Correct: Normalize the data before any downstream analysis.
1. Account: Directly model batch-to-batch variation in the downstream analysis.


|  | Pros | Cons |
|--|---|---|
| Correct | Generality. Allows for any downstream analysis. | Can introduce its own artifacts. |
| Account | Cohesion. Only one method needed for everything.  | Time consuming. Methods become "to big to fail." |

---

### Controls

A powerful idea in correction methods is to make proper use of controls:

* Replication: At specific stages of analysis, you can create replicates to clarify the nature of subsequent variation.
* Negative Controls: The experiment can be designed so that some features will not vary with interesting biological variation.

Effective replication and controls can help distinguish between upstream
biological variation (from the original sample) and technical variation
introduced later (during the sample preparation and sequencing).

### Analogy: Agriculture

These ideas have classical analogs in agricultural field trials.

Replication $\iff$ Growing the same variety in separate fields
Negative Controls $\iff$ Growing a variety with no agricultural inputs

### Challenges

Correction needs to be applied with care. It's easy for problems to arise.

### Challenges

Correction needs to be applied with care. It's easy for problems to arise.

.pull-left[
Miscalibration: Plugging in batch-effect corrected outputs into differential
analysis workflows can lead to miscalibrated $p$-values.

### Simulation

Simulation can give insight into the behavior of correction methods and their
influence on downstream analysis. 

1. Overcorrection: We can simulate possible forms of biological and batch
variation and benchmark using this as ground truth.

1. Miscalibration: We can create data with known null and nonnull genes and
calculate power and false discovery rates.

### Exercise

.center[
## Vertical Integration
]

---

### Motivation

1. Horizontal integration looks at the same features across many related datasets.

1. Vertical integration looks at the same dataset using many related assays.

### Motivation

.pull-left[
Why is multi-omics helpful? If a living system is a symphony, then each data
source lets us hear a new set of instruments.

### General Approaches: Latent Variables

Latent variable methods $Z$ reveal shared structure across data modalities.

---

### General Approaches: Network Inference

Network inference methods define edges within and between tables, showing how
measurements are related to one another.

<img src="figures/tree_integration.png"/>

---

### Challenges

1. Alignability: If one modality has little in common with the rest, then
including it forces us to ignore real shared variation in the other modalities.

1. Benchmarking: Directly validating associations is costly, so methods have to
be compared through proxies or simulation.
