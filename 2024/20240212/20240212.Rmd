### The Context

Models are woven into the fabric of modern life,

.pull-left[
Decisions: They can be automate or assist with judgments that previously would
have been done entirely by people.

Models are woven into the fabric of modern life,

.pull-left[
  Discovery: They can orient us within large data catalogs and can guide us
  towards promising hypotheses.

### The Challenge

Each class of problems comes with subtle objectives. We should...

* [Decision-Making] Respect the right-to-explanation.
* [Decision-Making] Promote socially-agreed-upon ideas of fairness.
* [Decision-Making] Avoid introducing new types of mistakes [cite Lipton]
* [Discovery] Ensure that analysis are reproducible.
* [Discovery] Highlight parsimonious and testable explanations.
* [Creativity] Allow user interaction and control.
* [Creativity] Avoid the homogeneization of perspectives.

### The Challenge

Yet, for so much of model development, practitioners still focus on
out-of-sample prediction error.

We need ways to encode the less obvious objectives as well.
