### Motivation: Microbiome and Mental Health

.pull-left[
* We now understand that the microbiome is closely related to depression and mental health disturbances
* To move beyond descriptive analysis and towards potential interventions, we need to understand mechanisms that relate microbiome composition to mental health

```{r, fig.cap = "A 'photo' of the microbiome along the gut lining, from Earle et al. 2015.", fig.align = "left"}
include_graphics("https://whatislife.stanford.edu/images/spatial.png")
```
]

---

### Mechanisms via Data Integration

The strength of WisSing is its experimental design: Clinical, behavioral,
genetic, and microbiome assays simultaneously across two populations 

.pull-left[
- The relationships across data modalities gives a window into mechanism
- Effects that are stable across populations are less likely to be influenced
by confounding
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = 500}

### Overal Statistical Approach

1. Quality control and preprocessing
1. Identify shared structure 
  - Project different sources into a common latent space `r Citep(bib, "Sankaran2019")`
1. Identify interactions that predict depression
  - Use tree-based models `r Citep(bib, "Basu2021")`

[Create a schematic to summarize this approach]

---

### Quality Control and Normalization

We will quality check the data as it is collected, allowing for corrections
before all the data have been generated.
  * Removal of sequencing batch effects
  * Filter samples with outlier quality control metrics (e.g., sequencing depth)

We will normalize the data to enhance power:
  * Variance stabilization
  * Imputation of sampling zeros

---

### Population-Level Effects

1. We will adapt previous methods for batch effect removal to support inference
of country-level effects
1. Following `r Citep(bib, c("CellAnova", "RUV4"))`, we will use linear models
with latent factors to isolate how molecular, clinical, and behavioral features
vary across sites
1. If an association is stable across populations, then that is evidence for a
potential causal role

---

### Integration via Latent Spaces

.pull-left[
1. Our first approach to integration is to search for shared latent structure
across the data sources `r Citep(bib, "Sankaran2019")`.
1. This identifies shared risk factor signatures across all data sources.

### Integration via Latent Spaces

This is an example analysis applied to a body fat distribution dataset.
  - The right hand plot shows a gradient across body fat types.
  - The left hand plot shows variables across multiple tables that are related
  with this gradient.

### Integration via Interaction Networks

1. We will learn cross-modality interactions using iterative Random Forests (iRF).

1. Since this is a predictive model, it will focus on those features that are
associated with depression. Further, since the predictive features include
interactions, it can learn to relate features across sources.

---

### Integration via Interaction Networks

1. iRF has succeeded in several benchmarks of regulatory network inference --
likely due to its ability to handle nonlinear effects and non-gaussian data
distributions.

1. We extend cross-omics integration to incorporate clincial and behavioral
measurements.

---

### Management and Reproducibility

1. We will prepare data, model outputs, adn code notebooks so that they can
become a resource for the gut-brain axis research community.
1. We will host both raw and preprocessed data through the SRA, a library
permanent URL, and an R Bioconductor ExperimentData package.
1. GitHub-hosted notebooks will ensures transparency and re-usability of our
data analysis approach.

---

### Conclusion

1. Data integration is often presented as a technical challenge. However, for
WisSing, the rich experimental design drives our statistical power.

1. The team has the type of complementary experience necessary to enable
thoughtful integration.
