### Motivation: Microbiome and Mental Health

.pull-left[
* We now understand that the microbiome is closely related to depression and mental health disturbances `r Citep(bib, c("winter2018gut", "Bosch2022"))`.
* To move beyond descriptive analysis and towards potential interventions, we need to understand mechanisms underlying this relationship.

```{r, fig.cap = paste0("The microbiome along the gut lining, from ", Citep(bib, 'Earle2015'), "."), fig.align = "center"}

```
]

---

### Mechanisms via Data Integration

A strength of WisSing is its experimental design: Clinical, behavioral, genetic,
and microbiome assays simultaneously across two populations.

.pull-left[
- The relationships across data modalities give a window into mechanism.
- Stable effects across populations are less likely to be confoundd.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = 500}
include_graphics("figure/wissing-integration.png")
```
]

### Quality Control and Normalization

We will quality check the data as it is collected, allowing for corrections
before all the data have been generated.
  * Removal batch effects across sequencing runs `r Citep(bib, c("Gagnon-Bartsch2012-dq", "Wang2020-iy"))`.
  * Filter samples with outlier quality control metrics `r Citep(bib, "McCarthy2017-hx")`.

---

### Quality Control and Normalization

We will normalize the data to enhance power:
  * Variance stabilization minimizes the impact of highly skewed data `r Citep(bib, "Law2014-qj")`.
  * Imputation procedures make linear model assumptions viable `r Citep(bib,"Jiang2021-jt")`.

### Population-Level Effects

1. We will adapt previous methods for batch effect removal to support inference
of country-level effects.
1. Following `r Citep(bib, c("Zhang2023-rr", "Gagnon-Bartsch2012-dq"))`, we will use linear models
with latent factors to isolate how molecular, clinical, and behavioral features
vary across sites.
1. If an association is stable across populations, then that is evidence for a
potential causal role.

### Integration via Latent Spaces

.pull-left[
1. Our first approach to integration is to search for shared latent structure
across the data modalities `r Citep(bib, "Sankaran2019-bf")`.
1. This identifies shared risk factor signatures across all sources.

### Integration via Latent Spaces

This is an example analysis applied to a study relating the microbiome to body fat distribution `r Citep(bib, "Min2019-gf")`.
  - The right hand plot shows a gradient across body types.
  - The left-hand plot shows variables across multiple tables that are related
  with this gradient.

### Integration via Interaction Networks

.pull-left[
1. We will learn cross-modality interactions with iterative Random Forests (iRF) `r Citep(bib, "Basu2018-tg")`.

1. Since this is a predictive model, it focuses on depression-associated
features. Further, since the predictive features include interactions, it can
learn to relate features across sources.

### Integration via Interaction Networks

1. iRF has succeeded in several benchmarks of regulatory network inference -- it
successfully handles nonlinear effects and non-Gaussian data `r Citep(bib, "Walker2022-ri")`.

1. Based on the tree's branching pattern, we can learn reliable interactions
between omics, clinical, and behavioral measurements.

### Management and Reproducibility

1. We will prepare data, model outputs, and code notebooks so that they can
become a resource for the gut-brain axis research community.
1. We will host both raw and preprocessed data through the SRA, a permant
library URL, and an R Bioconductor ExperimentData package.

### Conclusion

1. For WisSing, an integrative analysis can drive scientific insight.

1. The team has the type of complementary experience necessary to enable
thoughtful integration.
