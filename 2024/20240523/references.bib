abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

We take a Bayesian approach, generating an appropriate prior via a distribution on partitions that we refer to as the nested Chinese restaurant process. This nonparametric prior allows arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates growing data collections. We build a hierarchical topic model by combining this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation. We illustrate our approach on simulated data and with an application to the modeling of NIPS abstracts.},

              the biological differences between samples are separable from
              batch effects, and thus, data integration usually involve a lot
              of guesswork: Cells across batches should be aligned to be
              ``appropriately'' mixed, while preserving ``main cell type
              clusters''. We show evidence that current paradigms for single
              cell data integration are unnecessarily aggressive, removing
              biologically meaningful variation. To remedy this, we present a
              novel statistical model and computationally scalable algorithm,
              CellANOVA, to recover biological signal that is lost during
              single cell data integration. CellANOVA utilizes a

              settings, to separate unwanted variation from biological
              variation of interest. When applied with existing integration

              signals and corrects, to a large extent, the data distortion

              estimates cell- and gene-specific batch effect terms which can be
              used to identify the cell types and pathways exhibiting the
              largest batch variations, providing clarity as to which
              biological signals can be recovered. These concepts are
              illustrated on studies of diverse designs, where the biological
              signals that are recovered by CellANOVA are shown to be validated
              by orthogonal assays. In particular, we show that CellANOVA is
              effective in the challenging case of single-cell and

  abstract  = "Microarray expression studies suffer from the problem of batch
               effects and other unwanted variation. Many methods have been
               proposed to adjust microarray data to mitigate the problems of
               unwanted variation. Several of these methods rely on factor
               analysis to infer the unwanted variation from the data. A
               central problem with this approach is the difficulty in
               discerning the unwanted variation from the biological variation
               that is of interest to the researcher. We present a new method,
               intended for use in differential expression studies, that
               attempts to overcome this problem by restricting the factor
               analysis to negative control genes. Negative control genes are
               genes known a priori not to be differentially expressed with
               respect to the biological factor of interest. Variation in the
               expression levels of these genes can therefore be assumed to be
               unwanted variation. We name this method ``Remove Unwanted
               Variation, 2-step'' (RUV-2). We discuss various techniques for
               assessing the performance of an adjustment method and compare
               the performance of RUV-2 with that of other commonly used
               adjustment methods such as Combat and Surrogate Variable
               Analysis (SVA). We present several example studies, each
               concerning genes differentially expressed with respect to gender
               in the brain and find that RUV-2 performs as well or better than
               other methods. Finally, we discuss the possibility of adapting
               RUV-2 for use in studies not concerned with differential
               expression and conclude that there may be promise but
               substantial challenges remain.",

               increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of
               individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for
               further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases,
               artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in
               the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on
               pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization. Results
               We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to
               facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control,
               normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package
               provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process raw
               sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready
               for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of
               plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data
               structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used

               analyzing such multitable microbiome data, as is often the case
               when new data sources become more readily available,
               facilitating inquiry into new types of scientific questions.
               However, stepping back from the rush for new methods for
               multitable analysis in the microbiome literature, it is
               worthwhile to recognize the broader landscape of multitable
               methods, as they have been relevant in problem domains ranging
               across economics, robotics, genomics, chemometrics, and
               neuroscience. In different contexts, these techniques are called
               data integration, multi-omic, and multitask methods, for
               example. Of course, there is no unique optimal algorithm to use
               across domains-different instances of the multitable problem
               possess specific structure or variation that are worth
               incorporating in methodology. Our purpose here is not to develop
               new algorithms, but rather to 1) distill relevant themes across
               different analysis approaches and 2) provide concrete workflows
               for approaching analysis, as a function of ultimate analysis
               goals and data characteristics (heterogeneity, dimensionality,
               sparsity). Towards the second goal, we have made code for all

  abstract  = "Microbial communities have been increasingly studied in recent
               years to investigate their role in ecological habitats. However,
               microbiome studies are difficult to reproduce or replicate as
               they may suffer from confounding factors that are unavoidable in
               practice and originate from biological, technical or
               computational sources. In this review, we define batch effects
               as unwanted variation introduced by confounding factors that are
               not related to any factors of interest. Computational and
               analytical methods are required to remove or account for batch
               effects. However, inherent microbiome data characteristics (e.g.
               sparse, compositional and multivariate) challenge the
               development and application of batch effect adjustment methods
               to either account or correct for batch effects. We present
               commonly encountered sources of batch effects that we illustrate
               in several case studies. We discuss the limitations of current
               methods, which often have assumptions that are not met due to
               the peculiarities of microbiome data. We provide practical
               guidelines for assessing the efficiency of the methods based on
