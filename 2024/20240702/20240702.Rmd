## Scientific Context

### Data Integration

For many biological problems, researchers gather data from multiple views,

.center[
<img src="figures/integration_types.png" width=1000/>
]

Data integration makes it easier to answer questions using all relevant data.

---

### Example: Cancer

.pull-left[
1. Data about molecular activity and cellular organization has clarified
when treatments are more likely to be effective. 

1. Several technologies and levels of resolution -- population,
person, tissue, cell -- need to be studied together.
]

### Example: COVID-19

1. Molecular data have shed light on the immune system mechanisms responsible
for variable COVID-19 severity.

1. Multiple high-dimensional sources can be integrated to identify key molecular
interactions.

## Statistical Challenges

### Adaptability

How can we enable careful statistical analysis across diverse data types and
experimental designs?

.pull-left[
1. General-purpose techniques
1. Effective diagnostics
1. Scalability
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/data_types.png" width=500/>
]

Biological insights can be hindered by inappropriate assumptions or the failure
to use all of the data.

---

### Reproducibility

Complex workflows which have many interlocking steps and may use black boxes
challenge scientific reproducibility and interpretability. The community needs
methods for,

.pull-left[
1. Assessing stability
1. Addressing selection biases
1. Supporting re-usable software
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/multimodal_flow.png" width=500/>
]

---

### Community Resources

Larger community databases can be informative, but may be noisier or only
indirectly related to questions of interest. How should they be brought into a
specific analysis?

.pull-left[
1. Cell type atlases
1. Gene function annotation
1. DNA foundation models
]

<br/>

<img src="figures/normal-distn.png" width=80 align="left" hspace=10/> Introduce cutting-edge biological datasets and problems to researchers from statistics.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<img src="figures/computer.png" width=80 align="left" hspace=10/>Provide training on current best practices for researchers who are entering the field either from statistical or biological backgrounds.

---

### Values: Interdisciplinarity

Our workshop aims to promote effective communication between researchers working
on complementary biological and statistical aspects of the data integration
problem.

.pull-three-quarters-left[
1. Focused discussions will clarify challenges and identify strategies for
interdisciplinary research.

1. Tutorials will help establish shared vocabulary that can serve as a reference
throughout the workshop.
]
.pull-three-quarters-right[

]

---

### Values: Hands-on Learning

We want workshop participants with varying levels of expertise to leave with a
concrete understanding of the current theory and practice of data integration.

.pull-three-quarters-left[
1. We will curate a collection of problems, datasets, and methods for data
integration which can serve as a resource for the wider community.

1. We will create opportunities for participants to present short research demos
and talks.

]

---

### Schedule

1. The program will span roughly three weeks with an initial tutorial period.

1. Following the tutorial, research talks will be broken up with discussion
sessions, participant-led demos, and lightning talks.

### Why IMS-NUS?

1. **Interdisciplinary emphasis**: The workshop relies on an environment that
allows researchers from multiple backgrounds to feel welcome.

1. **Statistics reputation**: Unlike related workshops on integration, we
emphasize the role of statistics, and the IMS - NUS connection will help.

1. **Location**: The strength of both the statistics and bioinformatics
communities in Singapore will ensure that the workshop balances theoretical and applied perspectives.

and abroad who have the potential to benefit from one another's expertise.

1. University Campuses: National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University
1. Research Institutes: Genome Institute of Singapore, The Bioinformatics Institute
1. Medical Schools/Hospitals: Duke - NUS Medical School, NUS Medicine, LKC Medicine

### Conclusion

We believe that this topic has the potential both to demonstrate the value of
statistics to the wider scientific community and to bring exciting, new problems
into the conversation in statistics.

Thank you for your attention and we are happy to take any questions.
