## Scientific Context

### Data Integration

For many biological problems, researchers gather multiple views,

.center[
<img src="figures/integration_types.png" width=1000/>
]

Data integration makes it easier to answer questions using all relevant data.

---

### Example: Long COVID

1. Molecular data have shed light on the immune system mechanisms behind long
COVID-19.

1. Multiple high-dimensional sources can be integrated to identify the immune
cell types and interactions that are important.

### Example: Cancer

.pull-left[
1. Data about the molecular activity and cellular organization has clarified
when treatments are more likely to be effective. 

1. Data from several technologies and levels of resolution -- population,
person, tissue, cell -- need to be studied together.

## Statistical Challenges

### Adaptability

How can we enable careful statistical analysis across diverse data types and
experimental designs?

.pull-left[
1. General-purpose techniques
1. Effective diagnostics
1. Scalability
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/data_types.png" width=500/>
]

Biological insights can be hindered by inappropriate assumptions or the failure
to use all of the data.

---

### Reproducibility

Complex workflows which have many interlocking steps and may use black boxes
challenge scientific reproducibility and interpretability. The community needs
methods for,

.pull-left[
1. Assessing stability
1. Addressing selection baises
1. Supporting re-usable software
]

.pull-right[
<img src="figures/multimodal_flow.png" width=500/>
]

---

### Community Resources

Larger community databases can be informative, but may be noisier or only
indirectly related to questions of interest. How should they be brought into a
specific analysis?

.pull-left[
1. Cell type atlases
1. Gene function annotation
1. Electronic health records

## Workshop Structure
]

---

### Goals

1. Support discussions that could lead to methodological breakthroughs in
biological data integration.

1. Provide training on current best practices for researchers who are entering
the field either from statistical or biological backgrounds.

---

### Values: Communication

Our workshop aims to promote effective communication between researchers working
on complementary biological and statistical aspects of the data integration
problem.

1. Focused discussions will clarify challenges and identify strategies for
interdisciplinary research.

1. Tutorials will help establish shared vocabulary that can serve as a reference
throughout the workshop.

---

### Values: Hands-on Learning

We want workshop participants with varying levels of expertise to leave with a
concrete understanding of the current theory and practice of data integration.

1. We will curate a collection of problems, datasets, and methods for data
integration which can serve as a resource for the wider community.

1. We will create opportunities for participants to present short research demos
and talks.

---

### Schedule

The program will span roughly three weeks, divided into two main components.

Draw a timeline with:

2 x 4 days: Tutorials

Facilitator training

8 days: Talks and Discussion 
Talks + Discussion

---

### Tutorials: Biological Data Management and Visualization

**Kris Sankaran** will provide an introduction to managing and visualizing
multi-omics data using tools from the Bioconductor ecosystem.

### Tutorials: Introduction to Regression Trees

**Wei-Yin Loh** will offer a course on tree-based methods and their application
to mixed data types that arise in biomedical settings.

### Talks Criteria

We will invite speakers based on complementary criteria,

1. **Compelling Applications**: Work that shows what is possible by carefully analyzing modern data.

1. **Statistical Foundations**: Research that draws deeply from the statistical canon and highlights opportunities for the field.

1. **Creative Perspectives**: Studies that have discovered surprising connections across fields.

---

### Interaction

Beyond the featured talks, we will create opportunities for both formal and
informal interaction among all participants.

1. Facilitated discussion
1. Lightning research talks
1. Data analysis demos 

We will curate resources from these activities onto public/private links
(depending on speaker preference) on a website dedicated to the workshop.

---

### Recruitment

The organizing team will recruit students, scientists, and researchers locally
and abroad who have the potential to benefit from one another's expertise.

1. University Campuses: National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University
1. Research Institutes: Genome Research of Singapore, The Bioinformatics Institute
1. Medical Schools/Hospitals: Duke - NUS Medical School, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine

---

### Why IMS-NUS?

1. **Interdisciplinary emphasis**: The workshop relies on an environment that
allows researchers from multiple backgounds to feel welcome.

1. **Statistics reputation**: Unlike related workshops on integration, we
emphasize the role of statistics, and the IMS - NUS connection will help.

1. **Location**: The strength of both the statistics and bioinformatics
communities in Singapore will ensure that the workshop balances theoretical applied perspectives.

### Conclusion

1. We believe that this topic has the potential both to demonstrate the value of
statistics to the wider scientific community and to bring exciting, new problems
into statistical discussion.

1. Our team is excited by the possibility of contributing to the IMS - NUS
workshop series.
