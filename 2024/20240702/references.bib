  title     = "Integration and transfer learning of single-cell transcriptomes
               via {cFIT}",
  author    = "Peng, Minshi and Li, Yue and Wamsley, Brie and Wei, Yuting and
               Roeder, Kathryn",
  abstract  = "Large, comprehensive collections of single-cell RNA sequencing
               (scRNA-seq) datasets have been generated that allow for the full
               transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide
               variety of biological and clinical conditions. As new methods
               arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical
               challenge is to integrate these datasets or transfer knowledge
               from one to the other to better understand cellular identity and
               functions. Here, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective
               method named common factor integration and transfer learning
               (cFIT) for capturing various batch effects across experiments,
               technologies, subjects, and even species. The proposed method
               models the shared information between various datasets by a
               common factor space while allowing for unique distortions and
               shifts in genewise expression in each batch. The model
               parameters are learned under an iterative nonnegative matrix
               factorization (NMF) framework and then used for synchronized
               integration from across-domain assays. In addition, the model
               enables transferring via low-rank matrix from more informative
               data to allow for precise identification in data of lower
               quality. Compared with existing approaches, our method imposes
               weaker assumptions on the cell composition of each individual
               dataset; however, it is shown to be more reliable in preserving
               biological variations. We apply cFIT to multiple scRNA-seq
               datasets of developing brain from human and mouse, varying by
               technologies and developmental stages. The successful
               integration and transfer uncover the transcriptional resemblance
               across systems. The study helps establish a comprehensive
               landscape of brain cell-type diversity and provides insights
               into brain development.",

  author    = "Efron, Bradley",
  abstract  = "Modem scientific technology has provided a new class of
               large-scale simultaneous inference problems, with thousands of
               hypothesis tests to consider at the same time. Microarrays
               epitomize this type of technology, but similar situations arise
               in proteomics, spectroscopy, imaging, and social science
               surveys. This paper uses false discovery rate methods to carry
               out both size and power calculations on large-scale problems. A
               simple empirical Bayes approach allows the false discovery rate
               (fdr) analysis to proceed with a minimum of frequentist or
               Bayesian modeling assumptions. Closed-form accuracy formulas are
               derived for estimated false discovery rates, and used to compare
               different methodologies: local or tail-area fdr's, theoretical,
               permutation, or empirical null hypothesis estimates. Two
               microarray data sets as well as simulations are used to evaluate
               the methodology, the power diagnostics showing why nonnull cases

               unknown. To explore whether severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of adipose tissue
               contributes to pathogenesis, we evaluated COVID-19 autopsy cases
               and deeply profiled the response of adipose tissue to SARS-CoV-2
               infection in vitro. In COVID-19 autopsy cases, we identified
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipocytes with an associated inflammatory
               infiltrate. We identified two distinct cellular targets of
               infection: adipocytes and a subset of inflammatory adipose
               tissue-resident macrophages. Mature adipocytes were permissive
               to SARS-CoV-2 infection; although macrophages were abortively
               infected, SARS-CoV-2 initiated inflammatory responses within
               both the infected macrophages and bystander preadipocytes. These
               data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of adipose tissue could
               contribute to COVID-19 severity through replication of virus
               within adipocytes and through induction of local and systemic
               inflammation driven by infection of adipose tissue-resident

  title     = "A modified Bayes information criterion with applications to the
               analysis of comparative genomic hybridization data",
  author    = "Zhang, Nancy R and Siegmund, David O",
  abstract  = "In the analysis of data generated by change-point processes, one
               critical challenge is to determine the number of change-points.
               The classic Bayes information criterion (BIC) statistic does not
               work well here because of irregularities in the likelihood
               function. By asymptotic approximation of the Bayes factor, we
               derive a modified BIC for the model of Brownian motion with
               changing drift. The modified BIC is similar to the classic BIC
               in the sense that the first term consists of the log likelihood,
               but it differs in the terms that penalize for model dimension.
               As an example of application, this new statistic is used to
               analyze array-based comparative genomic hybridization
               (array-CGH) data. Array-CGH measures the number of chromosome
               copies at each genome location of a cell sample, and is useful
               for finding the regions of genome deletion and amplification in
               tumor cells. The modified BIC performs well compared to existing
               methods in accurately choosing the number of regions of changed
               copy number. Unlike existing methods, it does not rely on tuning
               parameters or intensive computing. Thus it is impartial and
               easier to understand and to use.",
