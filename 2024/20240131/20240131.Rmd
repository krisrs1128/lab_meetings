### Solís-Lemus Lab: Themes

**Theory**: Making statistical assumptions precise and understanding their consequences through careful study. Figure from [(Solís-Lemus 2023)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207599/species-tree-inference)

### Phylogenetic Trees

1. These trees represent descent-with-modification in evolutionary theory.
1. Nodes represent populations diverging into separate species.

Phylogenetics help to:

1. **Clarify evolutionary relationships.**
1. Facilitate conservation in a changing climate.
1. Trace the origin and spread of pathogens.

### Gene Trees

1. Since genes evolve, they have their own sets of common ancestors.
1. For example, genes might diverge before species do, and they may flow between
already separated populations.

### Trees $\to$ Networks

An analogous inconsistency occurs if gene flow is ignored. Figure from [(Solís-Lemus 2023)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207599/species-tree-inference), see also [(Solís-Lemus et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syw030).

### Challenges

1. **Approximation**: Evolution is complex, and statistical approximations are
limited. For example, mutation rates are often heterogeneous.
1. **Scalability**: As the number of taxa increases, algorithms must face a
combinatorial explosion in the number of candidate networks.
1. **Signal**: Many important problems have limited phylogenetic signal. For eample,
this created controversy in the study of COVID-19.
