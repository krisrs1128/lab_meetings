### Learning Outcomes: Session 2

By the end of this session, you will be able to...

1. Design and carry out a power analysis or benchmarking study for a multivariate (e.g., network or dimensionality reduction) analysis
2. Discuss the building blocks of joint simulation: Latent variables and copulas
3. Discuss how to evaluate a simulator using summary metrics and discriminator classification

## Scientific Context

### Testing to Prediction

Last time, we helped our team decide on study sample size when the downstream
analysis is differential testing.

(Figure: Testing to Prediction)

An alternative, more ``machine learning''' approach is to predict the
differentiating factor and interpret the resulting model.

---

### sPLS-DA

To make this concrete, let's consider running a power analysis for Sparse
Parital Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA).

* s: Not all features are necessarily predictive
* PLS: We imagine that many features are correlated with one another
* DA: The response is one of $K$ classes

Since sPLS-DA is a multivariate approach, we need to model the _joint_
distribution across features. The marginals alone will not suffice.

### Copula Models

These are a type of model that "couple" a collection of known marginal
distributions.

---

### Copula Models

Intuition:

Original Data $\iff$ Gaussianized Data

* In the gaussianized space, it's easy to model correlation.
* The mapping back and forth is possible because we know the marginal distributions' quantile functions

---

### Copula Models


---


### Copula Conditioning

We might expect the corelation structure to vary across groups. This can be
accomplished by setting separate $\Sigma_{k}$ across groups $k$.

---

### High-Dimensional Covariance Estimation


---

### Factor Models

---

### Definition

Last session's code actually estimated Gaussian copulas in the background by default.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setup_simulator(
  exper, 
  ~ group, 
  ~ GaussianLSS(),
  copula_gaussian()
)
```

---

### High-Dimensional Estimation

We can use a high-dimensional covariance estimator using `copula_adaptive()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setup_simulator(
  exper, 
  ~ group, 
  ~ GaussianLSS(),
  copula_adaptive()
)
```

---

### Conditioned Copulas

We can allow the covariance to depend on group membership using the same formula
syntax we used for the marginals.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setup_simulator(
  exper, 
  ~ group, 
  ~ GaussianLSS(),
  copula_gaussian(~ group)
)
```

### Quantitative Summaries

### Classification-Guided

1. An idea explored in `r Citep(bib, c("Sankaran2020", "Sajjadi2019",
"Friedman2002"))` is to evaluate a simulator by how well a classifier can
distinguish real vs. synthetic samples.

1. By interpreting the fitted model, it's also possible to identify real-data
properties that the simulator doesn't accurately capture.
