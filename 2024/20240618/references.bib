  abstract  = "New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for
               analyzing read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method
               estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts,
               generates a precision weight for each observation and enters
               these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This
               opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology
               developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom
               performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even
               when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the
               earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear
               modeling and gene set testing methods.",

@ARTICLE{Jiang2021-jt,
  title     = "mbImpute: an accurate and robust imputation method for
               microbiome data",
  author    = "Jiang, Ruochen and Li, Wei Vivian and Li, Jingyi Jessica",
  abstract  = "A critical challenge in microbiome data analysis is the
               existence of many non-biological zeros, which distort taxon
               abundance distributions, complicate data analysis, and
               jeopardize the reliability of scientific discoveries. To address
               this issue, we propose the first imputation method for
               microbiome data-mbImpute-to identify and recover likely
               non-biological zeros by borrowing information jointly from
               similar samples, similar taxa, and optional metadata including
               sample covariates and taxon phylogeny. We demonstrate that
               mbImpute improves the power of identifying disease-related taxa
               from microbiome data of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer,
               and mbImpute preserves non-zero distributions of taxa
               abundances.",

  author    = "Eisen, M B and Spellman, P T and Brown, P O and Botstein, D",
  abstract  = "A system of cluster analysis for genome-wide expression data
               from DNA microarray hybridization is described that uses
               standard statistical algorithms to arrange genes according to
               similarity in pattern of gene expression. The output is
               displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the
               underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive
               for biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
               cerevisiae that clustering gene expression data groups together
               efficiently genes of known similar function, and we find a
               similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns seen in
               genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as
               indications of the status of cellular processes. Also,
               coexpression of genes of known function with poorly
               characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means of
               gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which
               information is not available currently.",
