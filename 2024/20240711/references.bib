abstract = {Language translation is slow and expensive, so various forms of machine assistance have been devised. Automatic machine translation systems process text quickly and cheaply, but with quality far below that of skilled human translators. To bridge this quality gap, the translation industry has investigated post-editing, or the manual correction of machine output. We present the first rigorous, controlled analysis of post-editing and find that post-editing leads to reduced time and, surprisingly, improved quality for three diverse language pairs (English to Arabic, French, and German). Our statistical models and visualizations of experimental data indicate that some simple predictors (like source text part of speech counts) predict translation time, and that post-editing results in very different interaction patterns. From these results we distill implications for the design of new language translation interfaces.},

Recent studies have shown this simple technique to be surprisingly effective, yet it underutilizes the complementary strengths of precision-oriented humans and recall-oriented machines. We present Predictive Translation Memory, an interactive, mixed-initiative system for human language translation. Translators build translations incrementally by considering machine suggestions that update according to the user's current partial translation. In a large-scale study, we find that professional translators are slightly slower in the interactive mode yet produce slightly higher quality translations despite significant prior experience with the baseline post-editing condition. Our analysis identifies significant predictors of time and quality, and also characterizes interactive aid usage. Subjects entered over 99\% of characters via interactive aids, a significantly higher fraction than that shown in previous work.},

              communities are associated with adverse health outcomes such as
              preterm birth and the acquisition of sexually transmitted

              understanding the key risk-associated features of these
              communities, their heterogeneous structure and properties remain
              ill-defined. Clustering approaches are commonly used to
              characterize vaginal communities, but they lack sensitivity and
              robustness in resolving substructures and revealing transitions
              between potential sub-communities. Here, we address this need
              with an approach based on mixed membership topic models. Using
              longitudinal data from cohorts of pregnant and non-pregnant study
              participants, we show that topic models more accurately describe
              sample composition, longitudinal changes, and better predict the
              loss of Lactobacillus dominance. We identify several
              non-Lactobacillus-dominated sub-communities common to both
              cohorts and independent of reproductive status. In non-pregnant

               domains than ever, a consequence of powerful abstractions,
               abundant data, and accessible software. As capabilities have
               expanded, so have risks, with models often deployed without

               synthesizes key principles from the growing literature in this
               field. We first introduce precise vocabulary for discussing
               interpretability, like the distinction between glass box and
               explainable algorithms. We then explore connections to classical
               statistical and design principles, like parsimony and the gulfs

               learned embeddings, integrated gradients, and concept

               review criteria for objectively evaluating interpretability

               In this position paper, we first define interpretability and

               learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions
               about unobserved data. In addition to using models for
               prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is
               receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this
               increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the
               notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the
               wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and
               what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to
               address these concerns by defining interpretability in the
               context of machine learning and introducing the predictive,
               descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing
               interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching
               desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive
               accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a
               human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of
               interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of
               existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories,
               with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and
               simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR
               framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide
               numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often
               underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions
               of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss
               limitations of existing methods and directions for future work.
               We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that
               will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

               unnormalized $R^2$ value in a linear regression of the response
               on the collection of decision stumps that split on $X_k$. We use
               this interpretation to propose a flexible feature importance
               framework called MDI+. Specifically, MDI+ generalizes MDI by
               allowing the analyst to replace the linear regression model and
               $R^2$ metric with regularized generalized linear models (GLMs)
               and metrics better suited for the given data structure.
               Moreover, MDI+ incorporates additional features to mitigate
               known biases of decision trees against additive or smooth
               models. We further provide guidance on how practitioners can

abstract = {Interpretability has become an important topic of research as more machine learning (ML) models are deployed and widely used to make important decisions. Most of the current explanation methods provide explanations through feature importance scores, which identify features that are important for each individual input. However, how to systematically summarize and interpret such per sample feature importance scores itself is challenging. In this work, we propose principles and desiderata for concept based explanation, which goes beyond per-sample features to identify higher level human-understandable concepts that apply across the entire dataset. We develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically extract visual concepts. Our systematic experiments demonstrate that ACE discovers concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent and important for the neural network's predictions.},

  abstract  = "Much contemporary rhetoric regards the prospects and pitfalls of
               using artificial intelligence techniques to automate an
               increasing range of tasks, especially those once considered the
               purview of people alone. These accounts are often wildly
               optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a
               blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains
               ostensibly ``automated'' services. This long-standing focus on
               purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design
               space: one in which computational assistance augments and
               enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This
               tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital
               challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider
               the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction
               between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the
               often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while
               promoting human control and skillful action. We share case
               studies of interactive systems we have developed in three
               arenas-data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural
               language translation-that integrate proactive computational
               support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and
               support learning by both people and machines, we describe the
               use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive
               models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a
               discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for
               intelligence augmentation research.",

  abstract  = "Bacterial secondary metabolites are a major source of
               antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. In microbial
               communities, these molecules can mediate interspecies
               interactions and responses to environmental change. Despite the
               importance of secondary metabolites in human health and
               microbial ecology, little is known about their roles and
               regulation in the context of multispecies communities. In a
               simplified model of the rhizosphere composed of Bacillus cereus,
               Flavobacterium johnsoniae, and Pseudomonas koreensis, we show
               that the dynamics of secondary metabolism depend on community
               species composition and interspecies interactions. Comparative
               metatranscriptomics and metametabolomics reveal that the
               abundance of transcripts of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)
               and metabolomic molecular features differ between monocultures
               or dual cultures and a tripartite community. In both two- and
               three-member cocultures, P. koreensis modified expression of
               BGCs for zwittermicin, petrobactin, and other secondary
               metabolites in B. cereus and F. johnsoniae, whereas the BGC
               transcriptional response to the community in P. koreensis itself
               was minimal. Pairwise and tripartite cocultures with P.
               koreensis displayed unique molecular features that appear to be
               derivatives of lokisin, suggesting metabolic handoffs between
               species. Deleting the BGC for koreenceine, another P. koreensis
               metabolite, altered transcript and metabolite profiles across
               the community, including substantial up-regulation of the
               petrobactin and bacillibactin BGCs in B. cereus, suggesting that
               koreenceine represses siderophore production. Results from this
               model community show that bacterial BGC expression and chemical
               output depend on the identity and biosynthetic capacity of
               coculture partners, suggesting community composition and
               microbiome interactions may shape the regulation of secondary
               metabolism in nature.",

  abstract  = "For a long time I have thought I was a statistician, interested
               in inferences from the particular to the general. But as I have
               watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have had cause to
               wonder and to doubt. And when I have pondered about why such
               techniques as the spectrum analysis of time series have proved
               so useful, it has become clear that their ``dealing with
               fluctuations'' aspects are, in many circumstances, of lesser
               importance than the aspects that would already have been
               required to deal effectively with the simpler case of very
               extensive data, where fluctuations would no longer be a problem.
               All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in
               data analysis, which I take to include, among other things:
               procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the
               results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of
               data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate,
