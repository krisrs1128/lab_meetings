1. How do microbiomes change?
1. The answer is complicated by the fact that taxa interact -- we can't just "add" beneficial microbes and "subtract" pathogenic ones.
1. We have to consider the community as a whole. Dysbiosis arises when the microbial ecosystem falls out of balance.

---

### Example 1: Diet change

---

### Example 2: Eels

---

### Example 3: Birth

---

### Example 4: Bone Marrow Transplants

---

### Key Questions

1. Who?
  - Which taxa are affected by an environmental shift?
1. When?
  - Are the effects immediate? Lagged? Do they persist?
1. How?
  - Are there host factors that mediate the effect?

---

### Transfer Functions

1. We saw an analogy in the Intervention Analysis studies of 

Figure: California study

---

### Transfer Functions

These are just a particular form of autoregressive model:

\begin{align}
	y_{t} = \sum_{p = 1}^{P} A_{p} y_{t - p} + \sum_{q = 0}^{Q - 1} B_{q}w_{t - q}
\end{align}

where $y_{t}$ is the series of interest (e.g., ozone) and $w_{t}$ encodes the intervention (e.g., new regulations).

---

### Transfer Functions

The pattern of AR coefficients determines $y_{t}$'s response to "pulse" and "step" interventions.

Figure from their paper/book

Note that, unlike generalized Lotka-Volterra models, they can model lagged intervention effects.


---

### Tree-Based Implementation

In our adaptation, we model each species $j$ using a separate GBM:

\begin{align}
y_{jt} = f_{j}\left(y_{j,(t - p - 1):(t - 1)}, w_{(t - q):t}\right) + \epsilon_{t}	
\end{align}

* To forecast $H$ steps ahead, we plug in our intermediate predictions $\hat{y}_{j(t + h)}$
* In principle, we could apply post-estimation smoothing to share information across related taxa.

---

### Tree-Based Implementation 

We also let consider non-time varying features $z$ associated with the host:

\begin{align}
y_{jt} = f_{j}\left(y_{j,(t - p - 1):(t - 1)}, w_{(t - q):t}, z\right) + \epsilon_{t}	
\end{align}

$f_{j}$ could learn interactions between patient characteristics $z$ and intervention indicator $w_{t}$.

---

### Digression: Mirror Statistics

1. Our autoregressive GBM gives a kind of smoothing mechanism.
1. To answer "who, when, how," we'll want a more formal inferential procedure.
1. We've applied mirror statistics.

---

### Mirror Statistics - Setup

1. Imagine a high-dimensional linear regression where most of the coefficients have no effect.
1. Consider splitting the data and comparing the estimated $\hat{\beta}_{j}^{(1)}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{j}^{(2)}$.


---

### Mirror Statistics - Definition

1. If $\hat{\beta}_{j}^{(1)}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{j}^{(2)}$ have the same sign and large effect sizes, then we have evidence that $\beta_{j} \neq 0$.
1. This notion of stability is encoded in the statistic,

\begin{align}
	M_{j} = \text{sign}\left(\hat{\beta}^{(1)}_{j}\hat{\beta}^{(2)}_{j}\right)\left[\left|\hat{\beta}_{j}^{(1)}\right| + \left|\beta_{j}^{(2)}\right|\right]
\end{align}

---

### Mirror Statistics - Definition

Show figure of $M_{j}$'s.

---

### Mirror Statistics - FDR Control

1. We can define a selection set $\hat{S}_{t} = \{j : M_{j} > t\}$.
1. The relative size of the right vs. left tail is used to estimate the FDR,

\begin{align}
\widehat{FDP}\left(t\right) := \frac{\left|\{j : M_{j} < -t\right\}|}{\left|\{j : M_{j} > t\}\right|}
\end{align}

1. Choose as small a $t$ as you can get away with while bounding $\widehat{FDP}\left(t\right)$.

---

### Mirror Statistics - Aggregation

1. The proposed method becomes much more powerful after aggregating over many splits.
1. But I will skip over this...

---

### Mirror Statistics for GBMs

We define mirror statistics for the immediate future by comparing counterfactual $w$'s:

\begin{align}
M_{j} = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{\text{patches } s} \left[f_{j}\left(y^{s}_{j,t - p:t - 1}, \mathbf{1}_{q}, z^{s}\right) - f_{j}\left(y^{s}_{j,t - p:t - 1}, \mathbf{0}_{q}, z^{s}\right)\right]
\end{align}

---

### Mirror Statistics for GBMs


\begin{align}
M_{j} = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{\text{patches } s} \left[f_{j}\left(y^{s}_{j,t - p:t - 1}, \mathbf{1}_{q}, z^{s}\right) - f_{j}\left(y^{s}_{j,t - p:t - 1}, \mathbf{0}_{q}, z^{s}\right)\right]
\end{align}

1. This is for the immediate future, but the same idea applies to forecasts $h$ steps ahead
1. We can also compute it for different patterns of $w_{t}$ (not $\mathbf{1}_{q}$ vs. $\mathbf{0}_{q}$).

---

### Simulation Study

We simulated data to compare,

1. Forecasting accuracy
1. Inferential quality

across a variety of dataset and method characteristics.

---

### Generative Mechanism

\begin{align}
    y_{it} &\sim NB\left(\mu_{it}, \varphi_{i}\right) \\
	\mu_{it} &= \sum_{p = 1}^{P} A_{p} \mu_{i(t - p)} + \sum_{q = 0}^{Q - 1} B_{q}w_{t - q} + \sum_{r = 0}^{R - 1} \left(C_{r} \odot z\right) w_{t - r}
\end{align}

* $A$ is a random, low-rank matrix
* $B_{jd}, C_{jd}$ are zero for taxa with no intervention effects. 
* Interventions are defined by random starting points and lengths.

---

### Generative Mechansim

Give a figure showing how the simulated data look like, with random interventions

---

### Data Characteristics

1. Signal strength $B$. Nonzero entries drawn from $\text{Unif}\left(\left[-2b, -b\right] \cup \left[b, 2b\right]\right)$ for $b\in \{0.25, 0.5, 1\}$ 
1. Proportion of nonnull taxa $ \in (0.1, 0.2, 0.4)$
1. Number of taxa $ \in (50, 100, 200, 400)$
1. Everything else is fixed, and life is too short to list them.

---

### Method Characteristics

1. Different methods: GBM with lags $P = Q = 2$ and $P = Q = 4$. MDSINE.
1. Normalization methods: None, DESeq2 size factors, DESeq2 size factors + $\text{asinh}$ transformation

---

### Forecasting Error

Figure giving the results

---

### Forecasting Error

Figure giving example trajectories for some common taxon, between two mbtransfer and MDSINE.

Give some commentary.

---

### Inferential Error

1. Nonzero rows of $B_{0}$ are true, instantaneous effects
1. True effects propagate: Nonzero rows of $B_{1}$ and nonzero rows of $A_{1}B_{0}$ are true, lag 1 effects
1. More generally, consider $\cup_{p' = 0}^{q'}\left\{\text{Nonzero rows of} \left[\prod_{q = p'}^{q'} A_{q}\right] B_{p'}\right\}$ tracks all truly nonzero taxa at lag $q'$

---

Show the power vs. FDP figure

---

Show the summary table of False Discovery Rate in the simulation.


This is consistent with recent work on mis-specification of popular microbiome hypothesis testing packages.

---

### David's Diet Data

From an early study interested in sensitivity of the gut microbiome fo environmental shifts.

1. 20 subjects, divided evenly into ``Plant'' and ''Animal'' perturbations
1. 5 days in the middle where they ate only Plant-Based or Animal-Based diets
1. Originally has 8 - 15 unevenly spaced timepoints per person. We linearly interpolated to a daily grid.
1. Originally had 17310 taxa. We filtered to the 567 present in at least 20\% of samples.

---

### Mirror Statistics

(boxplot of mirror statistics)

---

### Counterfactual Difference

Compared to the paper's original analysis, we can distinguish taxa with transient/long-term effects.

(Simulated trajectories for significant taxa)


---

These are the subject-level data corresponding to a few different trajectory patterns.

---

### Postpartum Dataset

1. How does the microbiome shift during pregnancy/after birth?
1. Filtered to the same samples as \texttt{10-fig4-post.Rmd} in the Data Repository link (Thank you authors!!!).
1. Again, we interpolated to a biweekly time grid :_(

1. Define perturbations $w_{t} = \mathbf{1}\left\{t \in [-2, 0]\right\}$ and subject-level covariates $z = \mathbf{1}\{\text{initiated birth control}\}$

---

### Mirror Statistics



---

### Counterfactual Differences

1. We wanted to reproduce the finding that Lactobacillus recovery is related to contraception initiation.
1. Unfortunately, our model does not seem to learn this interaction term (not enough samples?)

---

### Progressive Disclosure

These are subject-level data for a few of those taxa.

---

### Residual Analysis

1. On which subjects are our forecasts especially accurate/poor?
1. Had expected to distinguish subjects with poor recovery. Instead found subjects with differential stability.

---

### R Package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mbtransfer)
ts_from_dfs(...)
ts
```

---

### R Package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fit <- mbtransfer(ts, P = 3, Q = 3)
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tr_fun <- function(x) {
  mbtransfer(x, P = 3, Q = 3)
}

ws <- steps(c("birth" = TRUE), lengths = 2:4, L = 4)
staxa <- select_taxa(ts, ws[[1]], ws[[2]], tr_fun, n_splits = 20)
```


---

### Next Steps

1. We're implementing another baseline (the R package \texttt{Fido}).
1. We might try another dataset example from among those listed in the introduction.
1. We're considering adding the post-estimation smoothing idea, smoothing over tree or MDS space.
1. We tried different normalization/preprocessing methods, but none were fast enough to consider within our simulation experiment.
