### What could you do with a hologram?

.pull-left[
Simulators augment two kinds of reasoning: 

1. Drawing inferences about global parameters.
2. Examining the effect of imagined perturbations.

### Grammar of Generative Models

Transparent simulators can be built by interactively composing simple modules. Probabilistic programming has simplified the process.

### Reasoning with Simulators

It can be helpful to view generative mechanisms from mathematical,
computational, and graphical perspectives. For example, plate diagrams and for
loops both condense duplicated information.

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
beta = random_normal(D, 0, sigma2_beta)
for (i = 1...n)
  y[i] = random_normal(
    x[i] * beta, 
    sigma2_y
  )
```
]

### Discrepancy and Iterability

By learning a discriminator to contrast real vs. simulated data, we can systematically improve the assumed generative mechanism.

### Experimental Design Renaissance

Let's consider a microbiomics case study: To block or not to block?

* Blocking removes person-level effects...
* ...but increases participant burden.

### Simulation to the Rescue

How can we navigate trade-offs like this? Simulate!

Simulators provide data for more precise decision-making.

### Covasim

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the research community came together to build simulators that could inform pandemic response.
* E.g., "What would happen if we held classes remotely for two weeks?"

### Covasim

Covasim is an example of an agent-based model. Starting from local interaction
rules, it lets us draw global inferences.

Statistical emulators mimic the relationship between input hyperparameters and
output data, substantially reducing the computational burden.

### The Role of Statistics + Additional Materials

 We have many more examples, like the evolution of mimicry in butterflies, longitudinal study design, the duality between agents and particles, â€¦

**Inference and imagination**: Statistical calibration grounds us in reality while generative tinkering encourages us to imagine.
