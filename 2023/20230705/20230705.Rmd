### Introduction

These themes have recurred across almost all the projects I have encountered in
my research:

* **Multimodality**: Data are gathered from complementary sensors or assays
* **Ecosystem Analysis**: We would like to understand the interactions taking place in a landscape that are difficult to observe except through data.

### Motivating Challenges

* Glacier monitoring in the Hindu Kush Himalayas
* Designing treatments for Bacterial Vaginosis
* Understanding the role of the gut-brain axis in mental health
* Reducing climate change misinformation by understanding its spread

### Glacier Monitoring

* This work has grown from a collaboration with ICIMOD
* Glaciers provide important ecosystem resources, and their disappearance has a large impact on the communities around them
* Effective remote sensing data analysis could help generate maps over large swaths of area much faster than human annotation could

---

### Glacier Monitoring

Semantic segmentation models can be trained to distinguish different types of
glaciers [Ref1] and estimate glacial lake areas [Ref2].

### Multimodal Data

* When working with data from different satellite sensors, there is a trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution.
* A second wrinkle is that sources are ever-changing. If we would like to map change over long periods, it is necessary to integrate across them.
* Though we haven't explored this, it would be possible to integrate ground-level ecosystem data, like species counts from wildlife monitoring apps

(Figure of )

### An Experiment

* How robust is multimodal segmentation to modality missingness?
* Can we train models in contexts where all sources are available and then directly apply them to settings where some are not?

(Figure of Transformers)

This project was led by Yuliang Peng.

### Study Design

We studied Segformer models [Ref3] with early, middle, and late fusion.

---

### Results

---

### Opportunities

The dream would be to build models that automatically get better as new sources
are released.
