### Microbiome Data Science

*What*: My lab develops data science tools to help better understand microbial ecosystems, often integrating several data modalities.
.pull-left[
*Who*: Some of our active collaborations include work with:
* Psychologists to understand the gut-brain axis.
* Physicians to understand inflammation and HIV transmission.
* Microbiologists to understand pathogen invasion dynamics.

### The Future is Interactive

If you’ve taken any of my classes, you know that I use live coding to teach data analysis methods.

1. There are often mistakes and dead ends that we manage to work past
2. We can gradually improve our analysis through critical re-evaluation
3. We can tour the garden of forking paths, in the sense of `r Citep(bib, c("Gelman2004ExploratoryDA", "Pu2018TheGO"))`

(picture of a data analysis as garden of forking paths)

### The Future is Interactive

Why: My dream is to have a similarly fluid, interactive workflow for multi-omics. Interacting with data and models at all stages will promote both rigor and imagination in data analysis.

How: Build modular, user-centric software with a firm statistical foundation.

### Example 1: Visual Interactivity

.pull-left[
1. Shneiderman’s Mantra: "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand"
2. Lab member Kaiyan Ma has written an R package applying this logic to
longitudinal multi-omics data visualization

### Example 2: Developer Interactivity

1. Simulation can guide experimental design, methods benchmarking, and synthetic
null hypothesis testing.
2. We are developing a package that allows tidy-style learning and manipulation
of simulators.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
simulator <- setup_simulator(
  sce,
  ~ ns(pseudotime, df = params$df) * cell_type,
  ~ ZINBLSS()
) |>
  estimate()
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
simulated <- simulate(simulator, n_samples = 10)
plot(simulator, "pseudotime", simulated)
```

    link = ~ cell_type * ns(pseudotime, 3)

  estimate(sce)

of simulators.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
experiments <- list(methylation = methyl_exper, rna = rna_exper)
families <- list(~ ZINBLSS(), ~ GaussianLSS())
sims <- experiments |>
  map2(families, \(x, y) setup_simulator(x, ~ cell_type, y)) |>
  join_pamona()
